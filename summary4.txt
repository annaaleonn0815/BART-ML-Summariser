This study addresses the challenges of analyzing the factors that affect learners' online learning performance and improve the design of online courses. In recent years, researchers have investigated the factors affecting learning motivation, cooperative learning, autonomous learning ability, positive learning emotion, infrastructure and hardware, self-regulation, preparation, personality characteristics, etc. The study proposes a framework of using nonlinear machine learning models to fit online learning models based on SHAP values, especially Decision Regression (DRA), to better understand the impact and interaction of different factors. The results show that nonlinear models are better suited for online learning than traditional linear models.
