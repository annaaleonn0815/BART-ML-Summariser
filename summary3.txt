The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a critical illness syndrome affecting 200,000 patients in the United States each year. The mortality rate of patients with ARDS is 30%, and multiple evidence-based management strategies can be provided to improve outcomes. However, recent research has shown that ARDS patients are not recognized when they develop the syndrome, and do not receive the treatment options proven to reduce mortality. Algorithms that analyze electronic health record (EHR) data and alert providers when patients develop signs of ARDS have been proposed as a potential way to improve early ARDS detection.
