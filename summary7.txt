 energy demand is expected to rise by 47% over the next 15 years. The industrial manufacturing sector is by far the biggest electrical energy consumer, with a share of more than 30% of the global total. Energy (efficiency) modeling of machine tools helps evaluate energy efficiency in different machining conditions, providing a useful tool for investigating the energy mechanism. The existing modeling methods can fall into two categories: physical methods and experimental statistical methods. Due to the nondeterministic and process-dependent nature of mechanical machining, physical models are less practical. The sacrifice of computational efficiency becomes more prominent for flexible machining where frequent alterations in machining configurations can be usually observed.
