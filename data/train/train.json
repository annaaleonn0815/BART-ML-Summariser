        "input_text": "Phishing impersonated the overlook of email and appears to be as the legitimate source. This tricks users to visit phished sites through links given in phishing email. The phishers will trick users to fill in their personal information by sending alert messages asking to validate their account. This is done so that user will think that it is a mandatory action needed from their end. Anti-Phishing Working Group has defined phishing as a crime of stealing users credential data from financial accounts and identity information. In first quarter of 2018, 263538 number of phish were reported in APWG 1Q report. Referring to the fourth quarter of 2017, this is forty-six percent of from 180577. In addition, 233040 phish were detected in second quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter which was 263538. This was reported in APWG 2Q. This numbers were higher compared to fourth and third quarter of 2017 which were only 180577 and 190942. With an increase of twenty-one percent of phishing attacks. There were rises in the SAAS/webmail targeted market. The payment industry continues as the most appealing phishing target. Today many security researchers are depending on machine learning techniques to overcome weakness of existing approaches. This technique only requires previous data to analyze or predict future data hence it comprises a wide range or algorithms. Machine learning establishes analytical models by using complex intervention during supervised leaning. This technique appears to be appropriate for the detection of phishing pages, as this tricky can be transformed into a classification mission. Machine learning techniques were used to progress measures to perceive phishing actions founded on the classification of existing web sites, and these replicas can be incorporated hooked on the browser. Machine Learning models instantaneously detect the valid site and then advancing the production to the user at the other end. The key accomplishment is the structures of the website in the input data set and the accessibility of satisfactory sites for the structure of reliable logical replicas for the expansion of Machine Learning models for computerized anti-phishing identification. The main aim of this survey is to study the comprehensive analysis and relevant literature review that supports the research questions and propose an approach in analyzing and classifying phishing and legitimate websites. Phishing is one of cyber-world's major problems and leads to both industry and individual financial losses. High accuracy phishing attack detection has always been a challenge. More than 80 percent of users believe the green lock icon on the browser URL bar means the webpage is legitimate and secure, according to a report by Phish Labs. The confusing 'Safe' label given to verifiable HTTPS websites by modern browsers, even if it is a fake one, just aggravates the situations. To compare, a screenshot of the legitimate PayPal login page, visually almost the same as the fake one. This was the limitation of phishing website which gave machine learning to penetrate through it making it possible to identify if it is possible to identify whether the website is fake or legitimate. In a nutshell, phishing detection tools are crucial in ensuring safe online experience to users, to ensure that online users do not become targets to online fraud, to distribute confidential information to an assailant and to effectively use phishing as an attacking device. Unfortunately, a significant number of existing phishing detector devices has error classification caused by a delay in updating the blacklist due to human intervention in classification. Such weaknesses are often caused by the flaws in the precision of detection. These critical problems led many researchers to work on different approaches to improve phishing attacks detection accuracy and to minimize false alarm rates. The inconsistent nature and constantly changing URL patterns of attacks requires the reference model to be updated in due time. The goal of this survey paper is to study and analyze the previous works in order to identify the suitable approach in classifying phishing and legitimate websites. Based on the literature review, Machine Learning can be concluded and has been proven to be the most effective approach to achieve the aim of the paper.",

        "input_text": "The internet has become a hub of information and every single day, the articles on the internet are rising at a rapid pace, and so does the associated redundancy. It is necessary to read all these articles to get a complete insight into the topic, which is a time-consuming process. It is essential to find a solution to reduce the information into meaningful and manageable summaries. These summaries will be expected to focus on the salient details, while reducing the redundancy. It proposes to use neural networks and Natural Language Processing techniques to develop an efficient and accurate tool to summarize multiple documents pertaining to one topic, into a single concise piece of abstractive summary. Text Summarization is a way of converting a given large block of information into a smaller version preserving its content, overall semantics, meaning and purpose. Manual summarization of articles is a very difficult task. The two main ways of automatic summarization are: extraction and abstraction. Extractive methods of summarization try to identify the important parts of the text and only extract the whole sentences from the original documents. On the other hand, abstractive summarization methods create summaries in a more humanlike way. They use advanced natural language techniques and interpret the text, to generate a summary that uses a new set of sentences altogether. In this paper, we have covered abstractive summarization using an unsupervised graph-based approach to convert an entire document into a word-graph and then traverse it to figure out valuable patterns and form sentences using the most important parts of the document. Word graphs are generated for documents that are clustered based on their contexts and importance analysis. The findings and inferences achieved from our work in extractive summarization are briefly discussed and further used effectively in the actual innovation in the form of an abstractive multi-document summarizer. An actual abstractive summarizer would have a natural understanding of how a language works and can generate sentences like humans do. Finally, we evaluate our results using ROUGE1 metric which is Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation and BLEU2 metric which is short for Bilingual Evaluation Understudy. These metrics quantitatively describe how accurately a system generated summary reflects the main contents of all documents.",
        "target_summary": "This research presents a sophisticated approach to multi-document text summarization, addressing the challenges of information overload and redundancy in the digital age. The study proposes a method that combines neural networks, clustering, and word graph techniques to create concise and contextually accurate summaries from multiple documents on a single topic. Initially, the system clusters sentences from the documents based on their contextual similarities, which helps in identifying redundant information and retaining only the most relevant content. These clusters are then represented as word graphs, where nodes represent words, and edges represent the relationships between them. The word graphs are traversed to detect the shortest paths, which correspond to the most informative sequences of words, thereby reducing the text to its essential components while preserving its meaning. The final stage involves using a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model with a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture to generate a coherent and abstractive summary. This model is particularly effective because it not only condenses the text but also rephrases it, creating new sentences that accurately convey the original content's meaning. The research demonstrates the system's effectiveness using standard benchmarks like the DUC 2004 dataset, where it outperforms existing summarization models in terms of ROUGE and BLEU scores. The study concludes by emphasizing the growing need for such advanced summarization tools in managing the vast amounts of text generated daily on the internet and suggests future work to refine the model for even better performance in various applications."

To evaluate the results of various critical processes such as etch rate, deposition rate, film thickness, chamber matching, chemical mechanical polishing, carrier distribution prediction, and uniformity, the IC sector requires metrology. However, the traditional method of physical measurement is highly demanding in terms of time, equipment, and human resources, making it challenging to implement. Consequently, researchers have focused on developing models to predict these parameters as an alternative to physical measurement. Traditional statistical data-driven methods are significantly influenced by the choice of model, whereas machine learning shows great promise for the prediction of various process parameters in IC manufacturing due to its powerful data processing capabilities and the fact that no exact physical model or prior knowledge are required.",
        "target_summary": "This study introduces an innovative machine learning-based approach to predict deposition film thickness in the Integrated Circuit (IC) manufacturing process, a critical parameter that influences the quality and performance of ICs. The research compares the performance of an automatic machine learning model against traditional models like Random Forest, Support Vector Regression, and Multilayer Perceptron. The automatic model, which employs Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning, demonstrates superior performance with an R² of 0.759 and a mean squared error of 398.12. This model's ability to automatically select the most appropriate algorithms and optimize their parameters significantly reduces the time required to develop predictive models, offering a practical solution to the industry's need for fast and accurate measurements. The study also highlights the economic benefits of this approach, as it reduces the reliance on expensive and time-consuming physical measurements, thereby lowering production costs and improving overall efficiency. The findings suggest that adopting such machine learning models can lead to more consistent and reliable IC manufacturing processes, ultimately enhancing product quality and reducing cycle times. The paper concludes by recommending further research to extend this approach to other critical parameters in IC manufacturing, thereby broadening its application and impact."

The main format in which this information is growing is textual data. As a result, the key problem now is processing and understanding such a large volume of data. Condensing the textual content, also known as summarising [2], which is the act of minimising the amount of textual data, is the only option to address this problem. Condensing information into brief summaries is challenging, though. It necessitates having in-depth understanding of the content being summarised. This problem can be resolved using one NLP technique, text summarization, which is discussed further in this section [1]. The overview of the current methodologies is the primary topic of this study. Although several review articles for the text summarising of documents utilising BERT embedding systems have been published in the literature, we have critically examined and methodically described the most recent, significant, and important works.

The summary helps in easy and fast information retrieval by retaining the gist of the document as mentioned by Dalwadi et al. According to Arun Krishna Chitturi et al., the text summarization aims at consolidating the source document into an optimized form, preserving the overall idea and information intact. In layman's language, conversion of lengthy texts into short and meaningful sentences is the main idea behind text summarization. The need for text summarization is continuously increasing as today's world is getting flooded with a growing amount of articles and links to choose from with the expansion of the internet. Human beings tend to read the whole document to develop an understanding of it and generate a summary by keeping the main points in mind. It is getting extremely difficult to obtain the required information from this pool of words and sentences in a short period. Going through all the documents, articles, and different forms of information to manually summarize is extremely time-consuming and exhausting for humans. Summarization helps in saving valuable time and conveys the main essence from which the reader can decide if they want to dig deeper. The first automatic text summarizer came into existence in the 1950s and since then summarization has been enhancing. Text summarization can be used for various purposes like email summary, reviews of movies, news headlines, outline of student notes, summarizing information for businessmen and government officials, summarizing medical data for doctors, summarizing legal documents, novel or book summaries helping consumers decide to read them or not, and code summarizers as acknowledged by Deepali K. Gaikwad et al. Removing the important information because of the large addition of it on the internet, as self-explanatory briefing will be of more value. Following this there is an immeasurable amount of energy which concerns the age of the already programmed content summary structure which helps to establish the abstracts that follow consequently from the content, web, and the organization messages that are related with their own satellite's substances. This review contains and shows how the swarm intelligence advancements are carried out to accomplish the task of content summarization. Text summarization approaches can be broadly divided into extractive and abstractive text summarization. As the usage of the internet is continuously increasing so is the volume of information present. Sorting out the right information from this huge pile of information present is not easy, but if we have a gist of the document we are getting in, it will become a lot easier. Just like the abstract of this review paper gives its insight, text summarization does the same and generates a comprehensive summary. Thus, there is an immense need for text summarization to save time and effort.

Abstractive and Extractive summarization are two approaches to generating summaries from text documents. Extractive summarization selects key sentences or identifies major texts from the original content, while abstractive summarization generates new sentences that are semantically correct. With advancements in machine learning, particularly deep learning, the effectiveness of abstractive text summarization models has improved significantly, especially when using encoder-decoder frameworks. This paper presents an overview of abstractive text summarization by reviewing related scientific literature. It discusses the algorithms, methods, datasets, and evaluation metrics used in current abstractive text summarization models. The review covers various encoder-decoder mechanisms, the languages for which these models are designed, and the issues and challenges associated with these models. While some of these challenges have been addressed, others remain open for further research. The research gaps and future directions highlighted in this paper suggest that there is still significant room for improvement in abstractive text summarization models. Future research should focus on enhancing the efficiency and robustness of these models to meet the growing demands for accurate and contextually relevant summaries in various domains.",
        "target_summary": "This research paper explores the growing importance of text summarization in managing the rapidly increasing volume of digital text data. As information continues to proliferate across the internet and other digital platforms, the need for efficient summarization methods has become critical. Text summarization involves extracting key details from large amounts of text and presenting them in a concise, coherent summary. This process is essential in fields such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), Data Mining, Information Retrieval, and Computer Science. There are two primary approaches to text summarization: extractive and abstractive. Extractive summarization involves selecting significant sentences directly from the original text, while abstractive summarization generates new sentences that capture the essence of the source material. These summaries can be applied to both single documents and multiple documents, depending on the specific requirements of the task. The purpose of summarization varies and can be generic, domain-specific, or query-based. Generic summaries are broad and applicable to a wide audience, domain-specific summaries cater to particular groups, and query-based summaries are tailored to answer specific user queries, making them useful in search engines and chatbots. Recent advancements in NLP techniques, such as neural word embedding, Bag of Words (BoW), and modern deep learning methods like recurrent neural networks (RNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM), have significantly improved the accuracy and effectiveness of automatic text summarization. However, challenges remain, particularly in creating cohesive and semantically accurate summaries for long and complex documents. This paper reviews existing methodologies, datasets, and evaluation metrics used in abstractive text summarization, highlighting the progress made and the ongoing challenges in the field. The study underscores the importance of developing more robust models to generate high-quality summaries, suggesting areas for future research and improvement."

        "input_text": "Data preprocessing is a tedious task that often consumes a significant portion of the time spent on data science projects. This is partly because it is not a streamlined process but rather an iterative approach where the optimal processing steps and parameters are determined through trial and error. The goal of data preprocessing for machine learning is to find a data representation that yields the best results, meaning the format in which the machine learning model can most effectively map the input to the output. Data scientists measure the effectiveness of their preprocessing by analyzing machine learning metrics obtained when evaluating the model. However, this approach has drawbacks. Since multiple preprocessing steps are applied to the data, it is not always clear which steps improve or degrade model performance. Additionally, data preprocessing is just one factor that affects machine learning metrics, alongside model and hyperparameter selection. Non-experts often find it challenging to accurately assess the effects of their preprocessing pipeline due to the experimental nature of model training. Decisions regarding which preprocessing algorithms to use, which machine learning model is suitable, and what parameters are appropriate can be overwhelming, even for experienced data scientists. The AutoML community has invested considerable effort in addressing these issues, automating tasks such as hyperparameter optimization, neural architecture search, data preparation, and feature engineering. Although these methods can help broaden the adoption of machine learning, they often suffer from a lack of user trust, as users may not know if they can rely on these systems. A study highlighted the importance of transparency—displaying information that may have led to automated decisions—as a critical factor for building trust. Another issue necessitating the evaluation of data preparation is erroneous preprocessing, which can introduce technical bias, such as imputing missing values with the most frequent value, leading to data imbalance. To address these challenges, the paper proposes a transparency system for data preprocessing that provides insights into the preprocessing pipeline, helping to detect potential problems and errors and build trust in automatically or manually built pipelines. A key component of this system is a tracking mechanism that extracts metadata from preprocessing pipelines, with an emphasis on comprehensive summaries of the processed data. This metadata is then used to create visual presentations that facilitate the observation and assessment of the resulting pipeline. The system also supports formal comparisons between intermediate datasets produced by preprocessing tasks, offering a better understanding of the implications of each step. The paper presents an overview of the general approach and initial developments, highlights open challenges, and suggests possible solutions. It emphasizes the importance of evaluating the effects of preprocessing on both data and model performance, noting that this task is not always straightforward. The proposed transparency system collects comprehensive metadata on input, intermediate, and output data, providing data scientists with the information needed to evaluate data transformations and make informed decisions about pipeline design. A prototype and example use case were developed as a starting point for further research, which could include automatic metadata collection about preprocessing pipelines and approaches for visualizing changes in data between transformations. Another research direction could involve using transparency information to recommend preprocessing mechanisms by comparing different schemes based on data and change profiles generated by the proposed transparency system.",

Manual labeling is both labor-intensive and costly. To address this, the study proposes an automated method for generating training data using a bagging-based bootstrapping approach. This machine-labeled data, while valuable, often contains errors that can impact model performance. The researchers apply transfer learning to mitigate the effects of these errors, thereby enhancing the model's accuracy. The effectiveness of this approach is validated using two DNN-based NER models—a bidirectional LSTM with CRF and vanilla BERT—across English and Korean datasets.

        "input_text": "Nowadays, there is a large amount of written text on every topic as the world’s knowledge is easily available, from extensive news articles to Wikipedia pages. Since much of the information is structured in large documents and articles, there is an increasing need to summarize and process written text. This work introduces new methods for automatic summarization and compares several alternative models for this task. The focus is on preserving contextual meaning and reproducing the manner in which a person might approach this task. Summarization is particularly challenging in low-coverage languages since little research is available, and large annotated corpora for training complex models are not available. The objective is to overcome this drawback by proposing several models that compute relevant summaries and build an annotated dataset for further reference. Automatic summarization involves shortening a document or a collection of documents while preserving its meaning and context. Various compression percentages are used depending on the desired size of the summary, the complexity of the document, and the type of summarization. Automatic summarization can be classified into two types given its output, with a third hybrid type being added as an alternative. Extractive summarization involves selecting a subset of sentences from the original document and assembling them to form a summary. The main advantage of this technique is the correctness of the resulting text and the well-preserved semantic meaning. However, a drawback is its inability to preserve a smooth speech flow, as some extracted sentences may not have a logical semantic connection with adjacent fragments. Abstractive summarization produces a rephrased summary that closely resembles a human-built summary in terms of discourse coherence, but a major drawback is that grammatical and semantic correctness may not be preserved, which can result in altered concepts and vague meanings. Abstractive models also require large training datasets for language comprehension and generation. For this reason, this work focuses on extractive summarization, emphasizing the need to build a suitable corpus and value informative summaries over speech coherence. Ongoing research in text summarization and Natural Language Processing has mainly been conducted in English and other world languages, with a significant lack of summarization corpora for other languages like Romanian. The annotations require a lot of human effort and are time-consuming, as existing Romanian websites do not provide extractive excerpts for their documents. Low interest and limited research capabilities in studying other languages have contributed to almost non-existent research on this topic. However, progress has been made with pre-trained encoders and NLP tools, establishing a foundation for text summarization. This paper introduces a novel unsupervised method for text summarization based on pre-trained Transformer models, namely MLM for sentence importance, and compares it with some of the most popular unsupervised methods for this task. A small dataset with 100 Romanian texts and their corresponding summaries was built to assess the performance of different approaches. The corpus also serves as a test dataset for further exploration and research on this topic. The next section presents state-of-the-art models and techniques proposed for language models, summarization, and metrics. The third section covers the employed methods for extractive summarization in the Romanian language and offers insights into how the evaluation dataset was constructed. The next section presents the results obtained by our models, and the final section concludes the findings and lays out the foundations for future work. Both datasets are built for extractive summarization; therefore, accuracy is used to evaluate the performance of the models. Besides accuracy, metrics typically used for abstractive summarization, such as ROUGE and METEOR, are considered to capture similar sentences not selected by human annotators but still relevant as summaries. As seen in Table II, PacSum performs best on the ROUGE evaluation metric, followed closely by our model, MLM for sentence importance. The distinction between them is that our model is a randomized algorithm, and its scores needed to be aggregated. PacSum performs best on news articles, prioritizing sentences that appear first, as many news articles are written so that the main topic is concentrated at the beginning. K-Means with BERT Embeddings is the third-best choice for our dataset, while the approach with MLP on Handcrafted Features performs the worst. METEOR, a metric initially used for translation and later adopted for text summarization due to its corresponding features and consideration of synonyms, often correlates better with the human way of thinking and can be more relevant than other metrics. Our model performs best for this metric. In terms of accuracy, Pacsum is the best model, followed closely by MLM for sentence importance. The MLP on handcrafted features outperforms K-Means with BERT Embeddings for this metric since it is trained to maximize accuracy, often at the expense of other metrics. However, Table III shows a different situation where the MLP on handcrafted features outperforms all other methods for the Romanian dataset. The large corpus used for training and testing the Neural Networks model plays a crucial role in this performance, suggesting that a supervised method is preferable if large datasets are available. The aim of this paper was to propose and compare several methods for extractive summarization in the Romanian language, using mostly unsupervised models and a supervised neural network. A test dataset of 100 extractive summaries was also proposed to evaluate the summaries generated by the employed models. Several baseline models were implemented, including K-Means with BERT embeddings, MLP on handcrafted features, and Pacsum, which establishes the relevance of a sentence differently, with PacSum proving to be the most suitable with the highest ROUGE score. The final method implemented considers our approach, MLM for sentence importance, which mimics how a person summarizes a document by removing one sentence at a time while predicting masked words based on the remaining context. The masked words are relevant nouns and verbs that establish the document's main topic. The quality of predictions is inversely proportional to the importance of the removed sentence for understanding the article. A sentence score is calculated based on the difference between the loss value for predicting masked words before and after removing the sentence. Our approach was highly effective, reaching ROUGE scores comparable to the state-of-the-art and outperforming PacSum in the METEOR metric. Our results suggest that PacSum and MLM for sentence importance are the most suitable models for extractive summarization in the Romanian language, achieving the highest scores for our corpus without requiring a training set. For the English corpus, the best method proved to be the MLP on handcrafted features trained on the BBC News dataset. All methods use pre-trained BERT and RoBERT representations, but these models are trained using unlabeled datasets, indicating that bidirectional transformers can be trained and fine-tuned for summarization in every low-coverage language. Future improvements could enhance the corpus through continuous crowdsourcing of annotators to add new summarized content and reduce bias through peer review of already annotated articles. A dataset with over 500 summaries could be a stepping stone for training supervised methods for Romanian. An improvement for MLM for sentence importance would be to determine which words should be masked, possibly including non-randomized choices, considering more parts of speech or words relevant to the document's main topic. Additionally, optimizations in speed must be performed to enable multiple computations of the score for one sentence and the aggregation of these results, as the algorithm is randomized and should not rely entirely on a single score.",

Traditional methods of optimizing antenna designs rely on iterative processes, where the design is modified repeatedly until the desired result is achieved.

        "input_text": "Pre-trained language models based on the transformer architecture have become the absolute standard for state-of-the-art performance on a wide variety of natural language processing applications. BERT, a renowned transformer-based technique, brought a great revolution that had huge impacts on the evolution of NLP. Since its release as an academic research paper, this technologically pioneering NLP model has amazed the AI world. It's the first-ever deeply bidirectional and fully unsupervised technique for language representation that was pre-trained just using a plain text corpus. Numerous advancements are happening in BERT nowadays. One notable modification over BERT by Facebook is named RoBERTa, which uses a more robust architecture with massive computational power and an enormous dataset. Another method invented called XLNet was inspired by BERT's autoregressive formation. Both these models require substantial computational power, which becomes a problem for a particular aspect. For this power with less computation, another comprehensive model comes from BERT, compromising only 5% performance degradation named DistilBERT. Despite its small size, it gives a faster performance, and DistilBERT results in almost identical performance on similar tasks. Google announces ALBERT, a lite version of BERT. Even though it has fewer parameters than BERT, it produces significant outcomes. BERT establishes its supremacy over all other language processing units. The authors included a multilingual version of BERT (mBERT) pre-trained on the Wikipedia articles of 104 distinct languages, including the Bangla language, to serve as a resource for languages other than English. This renowned variation of BERT emphasizes the contextual representation for several multilingual tasks. This model showed promising results and obtained state-of-the-art performance on cross-lingual benchmarks by optimizing for language-specific tasks. This consequence yields a wave of implementing BERT on monolingual data. The monolingual implementation of the BERT model for a resource-constrained language like Bangla can create a new era of language modeling for Bangla. The majority of the latest BERT models are only available in English and other resource-rich languages such as Chinese, Arabic, and Spanish. When it comes to low resources like Bangla, it is still at the bottom of the heap, and it leads to the lack of availability of many downstream task datasets and pre-trained language models. Additionally, mBERT, trained in 104 languages, has two significant gaps. It was prepared using only relatively structured and limited language data from Wikipedia, and another being the aggregate weights of all 104 languages. This article has addressed those deficiencies and proposed a monolingual BERT for Bangla language based on a developed large Bangla language dataset (BanglaLM). In addition, this paper also discusses the process of the pretraining architecture of the BERT transformer model for Bangla, which we refer to as Bangla-BERT. This model has been trained from scratch, and its performance is compared to mBERT and other Bangla pre-trained word embedding models on some published datasets for sentiment analysis, binary and multilabel text classification, and NER. We have developed the largest Bangla language modeling dataset to train the proposed model. The dataset is 40 GB, with three variants containing around 20 million samples for each variant. The proposed model has been trained on a substantial quantity of unsupervised developed data (BanglaLM) before fine-tuning. However, it is initiated using the parameters that have already been trained before utilizing labeled data from downstream tasks. Most of the research in Bangla didn't examine the power of the transformer. Furthermore, none of them used an extensive dataset for any pre-trained model as the resource is constrained. This work examines the potential by fine-tuning a range of Bangla downstream tasks. The proposed pre-trained model has been compared to a range of non-contextual neural models, including Bangla fastText (skip-gram and CBOW models) and word2vec. We used some NLP datasets for the proposed BERT model's performance analysis. We compared them with classical machine learning and hybrid deep learning models, including LSTM, CNN, CRF, and proved that the Bangla-BERT model outperformed them. When we compared the outcomes to the current state of the art in performance, Bangla-BERT came out on top. As a summary, our contributions are as follows: this work proposes a massive Bangla unsupervised language dataset (BanglaLM) for language modeling; this paper presents the whole mechanism for pre-training the context-aware BERT model using BanglaLM; this work includes training a language model with the largest dataset ever created for Bangla and exploring the possibility of fine-tuning a transformer model for a low-resource language like Bangla; this work resolves the mBERT's limitation for Bangla (trained on limited and more structured data only) and mixed weights issues among 104 languages; we examine Bangla-BERT and show its effectiveness on four NLP downstream tasks: sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, binary, and multilevel text classifications; apart from that, compared to mBERT and other non-contextual models such as Bangla fastText (including skip-gram and CBOW models), word2vec, in these downstream tasks, we showed that the proposed model outperformed them all by a wide margin; we make Bangla-BERT available on the popular site Huggingface so that it can be adopted as the new baseline and to advance Bangla NLP research. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 contains a brief overview of the previous research on language representation. The architecture of BERT is described in Section 3, and the method used to construct Bangla-BERT is described in Section 4. Section 5 illustrates the technique for developing vocabulary. The following section describes the downstream NLP tasks and benchmark datasets in-depth and the acquired results. Section 7 details the comparison with the previous work. Section 8 discusses future work, and Section 9 concludes this paper. The emergence of Transformer-based pre-trained language models rapidly expanded the accessibility of high-performing models to the typical user. However, several established multilingual BERT models include Bangla, the only Bangla-specific BERT model known to date trains on minimal website data. We used the most extensive Bangla text corpus to pre-train the language model. This paper efficiently pre-trains the Bangla-BERT model following state-of-the-art BERT architecture. We make it available to the community with the training corpus and evaluation benchmarks. Practitioners from fields other than computer science can fine-tune them for domain-specific downstream tasks. Because of the ease of use of a pre-trained NLP model, its use cases are much broader. By publishing our Bangla-BERT model, we intend to promote deep learning research and applications in Bangla-speaking nations.

The study proposes an alternative approach by utilizing a Multi-Variable Regression model to reduce such bias and accurately map crime hotspots. The research combines public datasets, including Census and crime incident data, and employs machine learning models like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest (RF), and Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (XGB), with the XGB model showing the best performance in prediction accuracy. The results indicate that demographic variables related to marginalized racial groups exhibit low correlation with property crime rates, suggesting a step forward in reducing bias. The study concludes that it is possible to develop more equitable predictive policing models by carefully analyzing and preprocessing data to remove inherent biases, emphasizing the importance of continued research to refine these methodologies.",

        "input_text": "In this era of digitalization, tremendous amounts of textual data and electronic documents are exponentially pumping and advance to diffuse over the Internet rapidly. Habitually, online users found it time-consuming and effortful to find the desired information within a large body of text, particularly when filtering out the retrieved information using current search engines. This consideration has motivated many researchers to contribute to Automatic Text Summarization (ATS) within the Natural Language Processing (NLP) for saving users effort and time. Here, ATS technologies can be of magnificent help in addressing the information overload problem by, e.g., suggesting solutions that work around shortening long texts with summaries without losing the intended meaning. Although ATS has been researched for approximately 60 years now, it still remains a very active research area as many problems related to text analysis and semantic complexities have not been solved entirely yet. Glancing over the ATS literature, one can observe that most intelligent studies and summarizing methodologies have been conducted to support the Indo-European languages, such as English, while limited works have been dedicated to supporting the Arabic language. The Arabic language is a fast-growing language on the Internet with an annual growth rate of 9,348.0% (measured between 2000 - 2021), making it the fourth most spoken language in the world, yet it is less explored with respect to ATS due to its complex syntax, structure, and verb conjugation. Additionally, most Arabic-ATS approaches are experiencing poor to moderate performance due to the high linguistic complexity of the Arabic language itself. To clarify more, considering the low-resource Arabic NLP, the available supporting tools are suffering from many difficulties. Few of these difficulties include (1) ambiguity in recognizing the POS-tagging correctly in the absence of diacritics, which is often the case; (2) ambiguity in identifying word-lemmatization, which is because the Arabic language has a rich derivational morphology; and (3) lack of necessary parsing and tokenizing resources, including comprehensive lexicons. Furthermore, to the extent of our knowledge, few extractive-based techniques exist in Arabic summarization, and no work is suggested based on abstractive technique. The extractive technique means to shorten a given textual document by only focusing on essential sentences presented in the original document and ignore less important ones. The abstractive technique, however, can generate new texts that may not exist in the original document. Seeking to investigate the capability of the deep transfer learning model to tackle the Arabic ATS problem, this paper presents a text summarization system based on a Distilled Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers model (DistilBERT). This model is one of the emerging state-of-the-art pre-trained language understanding models, distinguished by its lightness and efficiency compared to the large (base) BERT. In a nutshell, this paper introduces an Arabic summarizer approach (ArDBertSum) that consolidates two extractive summarization stages, built upon DistilBERT. The second supporter stage strives to enhance the typical summarization method used by further shortening long/complex sentences. The research highlights the potential of using pre-trained models like DistilBERT for ATS in Arabic, demonstrating significant progress in the field. Future work will aim to enhance the readability and grammatical accuracy of the summaries, as well as to test the model on larger and more varied datasets to further validate its effectiveness. This study contributes to the growing body of research in Arabic NLP, providing a foundation for further advancements in ATS for underrepresented languages.",

Leveraging the DistilBERT model, the research focuses on addressing the challenge of information overload caused by the vast amounts of textual data available online. Despite significant advances in Automatic Text Summarization (ATS) for languages like English, Arabic remains under-researched due to its complex linguistic structure. ArDBertSum utilizes an extractive summarization approach combined with a domain-specific sentence and clause segmenter (SCSAR) to handle the intricacies of Arabic syntax, producing summaries that maintain the key information from the original text. The methodology involved fine-tuning the DistilBERT model using the EASC dataset, which contains a diverse range of Arabic documents. The model's performance was evaluated using ROUGE metrics, which compare the generated summaries to reference summaries. ArDBertSum outperformed other non-heuristic Arabic summarizers, achieving the best results in terms of precision, recall, and F-measure scores. Human evaluations also supported the effectiveness of ArDBertSum, though they noted areas for improvement in coherence and punctuation. The research highlights the potential of using pre-trained models like DistilBERT for ATS in Arabic, demonstrating significant progress in the field.

Monitoring dams is crucial due to the potential risks posed by factors such as extreme stresses, design and construction defects, aging materials, and intense human activity.

        "input_text": "The objective analysis of gait using wearable sensor systems is gaining importance in the treatment of patients with motor impairments. Various studies have identified gait parameters captured by wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs) as digital measures for gait performance in different diseases like Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and post-stroke Hemiparesis (HE). From a technical perspective, an important aspect in the signal processing pipeline for IMU-based gait analysis is the segmentation of the recorded data into meaningful portions. One basic unit of gait measurements is a stride, which describes the period from the initial foot contact (IC) of one foot until the next IC of the same foot in a gait cycle. Stride-level information is essential for defining walking bouts, the measurement of gait variability, or the computation of gait asymmetry, where differences between left and right strides are investigated. In their review about the use of wearable motion sensors for gait assessment, Brognara et al. reported that a majority of studies prefer the use of only one single sensor unit, which is most often attached close to the center of mass of the participant (e.g. on the lower back). For this sensor setup, the detection of ICs is very well investigated. Still, to convert a sequence of ICs into strides according to the definition given above, ICs of the same foot need to be grouped and hence the laterality of each IC must be determined. However, this information is usually not directly available from IC detection algorithms and, therefore, stride segmentation is not trivial. Breaks, turns, or missed ICs in the detection contradict the assumption of a steady alternating sequence of left and right ICs. Thus, only the explicit determination of the laterality of the ICs allows defining stride borders and additionally enables the differentiation between left and right strides which is crucial for the investigation of gait asymmetry. To the best of our knowledge, there is only one publication describing an approach for the distinction of left and right ICs detected from a lower back-mounted sensor: McCamley et al. used the sign (positive or negative) of the lowpass filtered gyroscope signal of the vertical axis at the sample of the detected IC to determine the foot it was performed with. However, the laterality assignment was not separately evaluated in their article. Furthermore, only young and healthy participants took part in their study and the transferability to patients with movement disorders and potentially higher gait variability needs to be investigated. Considering the high relevance of stride-level parameters, the left-right distinction is a crucial part of a lower back sensor-based gait analysis pipeline and needs further investigations, given the lack of suitable well-evaluated algorithms. Therefore, the goal of this study is twofold: First, we propose potential improvements for the algorithm by McCamley et al. and evaluate the algorithm on data from patients with movement disorders. Second, we present a new approach for the left-right distinction based on supervised machine learning (ML) including a cross-validation. For the experiments, a data set including 40 participants with and without movement impairments, that was previously recorded and presented by Trojaniello et al., was analyzed. The results of our study contribute to a better understanding and increased reliability of stride-based gait analysis in single-sensor settings. In this study, we investigated ML-based algorithms for the distinction of left and right ICs from inertial sensor data measured at the lower back. The pre-processing and feature extraction were based on the work of McCamley et al., who proposed an algorithm based on thresholding of one single gyroscope axis (gyrv). We also expanded the approach by McCamley et al. by two other signal configurations (gyrap, gyrcomb) and performed comparisons between the approaches. According to our observations, not only the gyrv signal but also the gyrap signal and a combination of the aforementioned (gyrcomb) are alternating in a gait sequence with respect to the left and right ICs. Our results indicate that there are different favorable input signals for different sub-data sets, reflecting that different gait impairments exist depending on the respective health condition. This is a valuable extension of the work of McCamley et al., who used only data from young and healthy participants. As the accuracy depends on the clinical population, an a-priori decision per subject for the input signal axis is required. The use of ML models allows the simultaneous application of multiple features as input for the binary classification. Besides the signal values, also the values of the first and second derivative at the IC time points were used in our experiments and two different sensor axes were exploited, resulting in a six-dimensional feature space. The pair plots underline that even if gyroscope data was not separable by means of just the sign of the filtered raw signal, it was possible to separate the classes when using multiple features and sensor axes. Further visual inspection of pair plots revealed distinct inter-participant differences regarding the separability of the classes by either the gyrv or the gyrap data on their own. Using a feature vector with different features from the gyrv and the gyrap axes automatically provides a signal combination that is more valuable for the classification than selecting only one of the gyroscope axes a-priori (like in the McCamley algorithm) or computing a hand-crafted signal combination like gyrcomb. The performance of the ML approaches can be described as superior compared to the algorithm by McCamley et al. Within each subgroup, the different ML approaches achieved similar accuracy values, indicating that not a specific model, but the separability of the data in higher dimensional space was responsible for the improvements compared to the algorithm by McCamley et al. Furthermore, there was no tendency that the group-specific models performed better than the model trained on all data, which hints to a good generalizability over clinical populations. Although the results indicate that the use of ML models for the distinction of left and right ICs is very promising, a limitation of this study is that the time points of the ICs were not derived from a dedicated IMU algorithm, but from an external reference system. Even though the instrumented mat is an accepted gold standard system for gait analysis, it could be possible that the IC time points have an offset compared to the results of a usual IC detection algorithm for IMU signals. However, for this study, the isolation of the task of left-right distinction was desired and the specific origin of the reference ICs can be considered irrelevant for the presented results. Furthermore, we evaluated the algorithms on an in-lab data set that was heterogeneous regarding the study population but not with respect to the gait movements. It can be expected that the classification will be more challenging for gait movements from real-life scenarios including curvilinear and inclined walking, as well as spurious, unsteady gait bouts. Hence, in future investigations, the experiments should be extended by assigning ICs detected by an actual IMU-based algorithm. Additionally, a validation on real-world data would be desirable in order to estimate the robustness of the algorithm on signals measured in challenging setups. In this context, an adaptation of the filters during preprocessing and an extension of the feature set should also be considered. To conclude, our study showed that the optimal sensor axis for the distinction of left and right ICs with the algorithm of McCamley et al. was affected by the investigated study population. Even higher accuracy was achieved by applying ML algorithms with six-dimensional input data. Our results will contribute to a reliable stride-based gait analysis using inertial data measured at the lower back and thus support clinical decisions in the context of movement disorders",

        "input_text": "Medical images obtained from the computed tomography (CT) and the Chest X-Ray (CXR) could manifest the resulted pulmonary lesions, such as multiple ground glass opacity and infiltration. Medical imaging technologies are, therefore, extensively employed in coronavirus detection and contribute tremendously to the quick diagnosis of the COVID-19. However, most medical imaging systems merely present the projections of lung condition and usually generate scans in large quantities, adding huge burdens to radiologists workload and severely hinder the rapid diagnosis of the COVID-19. Therefore, a more intelligent system with the capacity of analyzing the lesions in images and writing corresponding medical reports automatically is of great significance to the COVID-19 diagnosis, as shown in Fig. 1. Within such intelligent system illustrated in Fig. 1 for the COVID-19 diagnosis, medical report generation is the core component, which attempts to draw precise connections between lesion areas in images and their relevant pathological analysis in the text. Due to the naturally imbalanced distributions of normal and abnormal case numbers in training data, previous methods tend to focus more on the normal image patches. With the insufficient attention related to lung injuries, they usually produce undesirable findings and conclusions that contain incorrect terminologies. Thus, the proper import and acquisition of the external medical-specific knowledge are the key to the precise detection of the abnormal terminologies and the production of accurate reports. Nevertheless, in previous methods, the simple application of vanilla recurrent neural network (RNN) and its variants in language generation models without the external medical-specific knowledge hinders the model from fully utilizing the visual-and-linguistic information simultaneously. The emergence of BERT and its variant VL-BERT, however, provides a solution to this problem, making it possible for medical report generation system to exploit the external visual-and-linguistic knowledge simultaneously and produce more professional sentences. Equipped with these promising techniques, an efficient AI diagnosis system could be built for the quick diagnosis of the COVID-19 and largely facilitate the physicians treatment. However, the superior performances of a deep neural network, e.g., BERT and ResNet, usually depend on the scale of the training data. On account of the sudden outbreak of the COVID-19, the inadequate number of training samples concerning COVID-19 becomes the main obstacle for building an AI diagnosis system. Recent studies propose to introduce additional data for model training. Wang et al. collected a set of images of viral pneumonia to expand data size. Shi et al. added the samples of community-acquired pneumonia to their COVID-19 dataset. However, the model might be misguided by the introduced noisy information of other diseases and fail to capture key features of the COVID-19, resulting in poor performances on report generation. Therefore, in this article, to efficiently aid radiologists in diagnosis, the Medical Visual Language BERT (Medical-VLBERT) is proposed for automatic medical report generation. To effectively bridge the vision-and-language gap and improve the model performance, we further employ an alternate learning fashion that contains two procedures: knowledge pretraining and knowledge transferring. On the one hand, the pretraining procedure learns to parse and memorize the knowledge contained in medical textbooks. On the other hand, the transferring procedure further utilizes the acquired knowledge to generate medical reports. In practice, both procedures are executed on two major components: 1) terminology encoder and 2) shared language decoder. Specifically, the terminology encoder processes the multimodal features, i.e., medical images and medical reports features, and finds their mutual relation. Then, the shared language decoder performs the sentence generation based on the information obtained from terminology encoder. For the current study on automatic medical report generation for COVID-19 cases, we are the first to construct a dataset of 368 medical findings in Chinese about 96 patients and 1104 corresponding chest CT scans under the guidance of the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia. Instead of combining COVID-19 data with additional information in model training, we adopt a transfer learning strategy. In practice, considering the syntactic similarity shared in the medical report, we first train our model on the large-scale CX-CHR dataset consisting of 45,598 X-ray images and their findings in Chinese. Then, we fine-tune the model on the newly built COVID-19 datasets, using both accurate medical tags and findings on the COVID-19. Note that, even though the screening techniques are different, the medical reports share similar formats so that the transfer can benefit from the pretrained language BERT model. In summary, our main contributions are fourfold. 1) We present Medical-VLBERT for automatic medical report generation. It is the first model that can produce medical reports for the COVID-19 CT scans to the best of our knowledge. 2) We adopt a transfer learning strategy in model training to alleviate the shortage of the available COVID-19 data. The transferred knowledge provides professional guidance for medical report generation. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performances on both terminology prediction and report generation on the COVID-19 CT dataset. 3) We develop an alternate training strategy for both pretraining and transferring procedures to minimize the discrepancies between the medical scans and the diagnosis texts, as well as to maximize the accuracy of the produced reports. 4) We build a COVID-19 CT dataset that contains 1,104 CT scans and 368 standardized Chinese medical reports by professional radiologists based on the data of 96 patients under the guidance of the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia. We have released the COVID-19 CT dataset to the community. In this work, we proposed the Medical-VLBERT model for automatic medical report generation on the COVID-19 CT scans. Medical-VLBERT further adopts an alternate learning strategy that can use the transferred medical textual knowledge to identify the abnormality in CT images and generate the medical report automatically based on the detected lesion regions with acquired knowledge. Besides, we built a COVID-19 CT dataset of 368 medical findings in Chinese and 1104 chest CT scans from The First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University and The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University. To solve the COVID-19 data shortage problem, we employed a transfer learning fashion in which the model is first trained on the large-scale CX-CHR dataset in Chinese and then fine-tuned on the COVID-19 CT dataset. Results and analysis in our experiments proved that our model has state-of-the-art performances on terminology prediction and report generation on the Chinese COVID-19 CT dataset and the Chinese CX-CHR dataset. Furthermore, in clinical practice, our model could help ease the radiologists burdens via aiding their diagnostic workflow, including analyzing the lesions in images and writing corresponding medical reports for diagnosed patients. In the future, we will pay more attention to the diagnostic phase information on a patients timelines and focus on the generation of more integrated reports",

        "input_text": "Machine learning, an integral part of the broader field of artificial intelligence, has transformed how we process and interpret data, enabling computers to learn and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming. With advancements in algorithms, computing power, and the availability of vast datasets, machine learning has made significant strides in various domains, from healthcare to finance, natural language processing to computer vision. However, as the scope and complexity of machine learning tasks expand, so do the challenges. The monumental growth of data presents a paradox: while larger datasets hold the potential for more accurate models and predictions, they also impose severe computational and logistical constraints on traditional machine learning approaches. Training models on such colossal datasets using conventional, centralized computing infrastructures becomes impractical due to issues of scalability, efficiency, and resource limitations. This is where Distributed Machine Learning (DML) emerges as an enabling paradigm. DML represents the convergence of machine learning and distributed computing, offering solutions to the challenges posed by big data and complex model architectures. By distributing the training task of machine learning models across multiple machines, nodes, or even edge devices, DML overcomes the limitations of centralized systems and empowers us to tackle intricate problems that were previously insurmountable. The core concept behind DML is straightforward: instead of relying on a single computational unit to process the entire dataset and train a model, the workload is divided among multiple machines, each processing a subset of the data or contributing to the model’s training. This distributed approach accelerates the training process and enhances scalability, fault tolerance, and resource utilization. In essence, DML harnesses the power of parallelism, allowing us to exploit the capabilities of numerous computing resources in unison. The motivation for embracing DML extends beyond the practicalities of handling vast datasets. DML offers a promising framework for collaborative learning without exposing sensitive information in a world increasingly concerned with data privacy and security. Federated Learning, a subset of DML, takes this concept further by allowing machine learning models to be trained across decentralized devices or data silos while preserving user privacy. In this comprehensive exploration of Distributed Machine Learning, we delve into the core principles, techniques, frameworks, and real-world applications that define this burgeoning field. We also examine the challenges that come with distributing the machine learning process and the innovative solutions that researchers and practitioners are developing to address these challenges. Distributed Machine Learning is essential for tackling large-scale machine learning challenges in the era of big data. We aimed to provide a reader with the knowledge and skills to leverage the power of distributed computing for training advanced machine learning models. We hope it helps apply distributed machine learning techniques to one’s projects and contribute to advancing the field",

        "input_text": "Machine learning (ML) continues to gain prevalence across various domains, including finance, policing, and advertising. Particularly in healthcare, ML has been embraced by researchers who are actively working on a range of issues from interpreting high-dimensional medical data to predicting cancer. However, despite this widespread adoption of medicine in ML research, it has not been uniformly accepted by domain experts in the field, with the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) models in medical workflows often eliciting mixed emotions. While some experts embrace the potential of leveraging AI, others express fear and distrust in AI systems. Therefore, there’s a serious challenge of improving trust in medical AI models that must be addressed before we can assume adoption of said models. Researchers have made efforts to tackle this distrust by developing Explainable AI (XAI) systems, aiming to install rational trust through explanations of AI models, such as saliency maps and model visualizations. However, most of this work primarily considers engendering rational trust with regards to an existing AI model after its development, with little research exploring means for engendering trust during the model development process through affective and normative trust between those creating the model. To address this research gap, we introduce the Embodied Machine Learning (EML) system, which aims to engender affective and normative trust in AI through frequent interaction and collaboration between data scientists and domain experts during the medical AI model development process. We achieve this by shifting the process of labeling and model fine-tuning from the desktop to a large multi-touch interface, capitalizing on the benefits of embodied interactions and large form factor displays to promote collaboration and sensemaking. The system aims to achieve the following goals: increasing affective trust through increased collaboration between domain experts and data scientists during the training process, and increasing normative trust through increased interactions between domain experts and the machine learning models they train. To evaluate these goals, we present a user study, and its results highlighted increases in drivers of both normative and affective trust, increased trust in the resulting model, as well as more pointed model goals. We’ve presented EML, a system for embodied machine learning training around a multi-touch tabletop display, with the goal of increasing affective and normative trust in medical ML research. Based on the related work, we’ve highlighted deficiencies in engendering trust in current medical ML research workflows, as well as methods for addressing them through embodied interactions at large form factor displays. Building on this related work, we then presented the design of the EML system and provided both an expert evaluation and a user study to collect feedback on our design. From these evaluations, we have highlighted the efficacy of the EML system in engendering trust and collaboration, while also noting areas for future work.",

        "input_text": "In recent years, there has been enormous progress in developing machine learning methods that incorporate exact symmetries. Indeed, the revolutionary performance of convolutional neural networks was enabled by the imposition of a local translational symmetry at the bottom layer of the networks. When a learning problem obeys an exact symmetry, we have the strong intuition that imposing symmetry on the method must improve learning and generalization. Much of the work on exact symmetries has been situated in physics and natural-science domains because physical laws exactly obey a panoply of symmetries. One of the symmetries of physics—and indeed all of the sciences—is the symmetry underlying dimensional analysis. Quantities that are added or subtracted must have identical units – if the units system of the inputs to a function is changed, the units of the output must change accordingly. This symmetry—which we call “units equivariance” but in physics, it might be more natural to call this units covariance—is a passive symmetry that applies to all problems. It has many implications. One is that it is possible to derive scalings and dependencies of outputs on inputs from the units directly. For example, if a problem involves only a length L, an acceleration g, and a mass m, and the problem is to learn or predict a time t, it is possible from units alone to see that t ∝ p L/g. Another implication is that inhomogeneous functions, such as transcendental functions and most non-linear functions, can only be applied to dimensionless (unitless) quantities: if a quantity x is dimensional, an inhomogeneous polynomial expression in x is inconsistent with the principle that quantities to be added or subtracted must have identical units. These dimensional symmetries are strict and exact and apply to essentially every problem in the sciences. In chemistry, ecology, and economics, for example, the inputs and the outputs of functional relationships have non-trivial units, and the results must be equivariant to the choice of units system. Machine learning methods for physical sciences are often designed in such a way that implies units-equivariance, even if they don’t explicitly say so. In this work, we implement a particular case of group-equivariant machine learning for the group corresponding to changes in units. We make use of dimensionless quantities, which are the invariants of this group. We thereby build on our previous work in which group invariants are used to build group-equivariant functions. Our procedure here builds dimensionless features out of the problem inputs and then ensures that the resulting outputs are scaled back to their correct dimensions or units. The guiding philosophy of the work is to transform the inputs into invariant features before they are used to train a machine learning method, and then to un-transform label predictions at the output or at test time. These approaches to symmetry-respecting machine learning are simple to implement and perform well. In what follows, we will make the strong assumption that the dimensions and units of all regression inputs are known, complete, and self-consistent. However, a different direction of research is to look at how dimensional relationships or other symmetries are discovered. This is the setting for discovering dimensional structure, which connects to prior work as a particular case of the more general problem of learning symmetries from data. Our contributions: We provide a definition for units equivariance as an equivariance with respect to a group action, and incorporate it into machine learning models, aided by ideas from classical dimensional analysis. We show that exact units equivariance is easy to impose on many kinds of learning tasks, by constructing a dimensionless version of the learning task, performing the dimensionless task, and then scaling back in the proper dimensions (and units) at the end (perhaps prior to evaluating the cost function). Dimensionless quantities are invariants with respect to changes in units and can be computed using discrete linear algebra algorithms. In this sense, the approach we advocate here is related to approaches based on group invariants to impose exact group equivariances. We discuss extensions of theoretical results on generalization bounds for regression problems under symmetries generated by compact groups to the group of scalings (which is not compact but reductive). We demonstrate with a few simple numerical regression problems that the reduction of model capacity (at fixed complexity) delivered by the units equivariance leads to improvements in generalization (in-distribution and out-of-distribution). In this context, we discuss symbolic regression and emulator-related tasks. We also discuss the limitations of our approach in the context of unknown dimensional constants. In the above, we defined units equivariance for machine learning, with a focus on regression and complex functions. A function obeying this equivariance obeys the exact scalings that are required by the rules of dimensional analysis. These scalings must be obeyed by any theory or function in use in the natural sciences. We developed a simple framework for implementing units equivariance into regression problems. This framework puts burdens on the investigator—burdens of having consistent units for all inputs, and also a comprehensive list of dimensional constants—but is otherwise lightweight in terms of modifying existing regression methods. We did not consider the important problems of learning dimensions or the discovery of missing dimensionless inputs, but these are worthy extensions of what we looked at here. We argued that imposing units equivariance must improve the bias and variance of regression methods, both because it incorporates correct information, and also because it reduces model capacity at fixed complexity, often by an enormous factor. The equivariance also enables out-of-sample generalization because a test set that doesn’t overlap a training set in dimensional inputs will often significantly overlap in dimensionless combinations of those inputs. We illustrated these effects empirically with a few simple experiments. Units equivariance applies to all functions in the natural sciences. It won’t be useful everywhere. In particular, it is most useful when there are many independent units at play, and the full panoply of physical constants is known. This is not true, say, for standard image-recognition tasks, for which all the inputs have the same units (intensity in image pixels) and the physical quantities (involved in the identification of pandas and kittens, say) are not known. It is also not true in natural-science problems where there might be unknown physical constants or physical laws at play. The discovery of physical laws is often the discovery of dimensional physical constants, as our black-body radiation law example problem illustrates. However, we are very optimistic about the usefulness of units equivariance in problems of emulation and symbolic regression. In these settings, all symmetries are exact, and often all inputs (including all fundamental constants) are known (and have known units). In particular, some of the cleanest physics problems might be in the area of the growth of structure in the Universe, where there are very few dimensioned quantities and the physics is dominated by one force (gravity). These problems are of great interest at the present day and have attracted very promising work with machine learning methods",
        "target_summary": "This study explores the incorporation of exact symmetries, specifically units equivariance, into machine learning models, particularly in regression tasks within the physical sciences. By leveraging the symmetry underlying dimensional analysis, the researchers propose a method that constructs dimensionless features from problem inputs, ensuring that outputs are scaled back to their correct dimensions. This approach aims to improve model generalization, reduce bias and variance, and enable better out-of-sample predictions by aligning with the fundamental laws of physics. The study demonstrates that imposing units equivariance simplifies the learning process by reducing model capacity while maintaining complexity. While the framework places certain burdens on ensuring consistent units and comprehensive dimensional constants, it offers significant benefits, particularly in problems where all relevant symmetries are exact. The researchers highlight the potential of this approach in fields like symbolic regression and emulation, especially in areas dominated by known physical constants."

        "input_text": "During software evolution, software defects are often expensive to fix, especially when they are discovered late in development or after release, making defect prediction a critical activity in software quality assurance. The ability to accurately identify defective software units early in development provides valuable insights that can improve software testing and defect fixes by focusing testing and quality assurance efforts where needed. With the growth in code size and complexity, manually inspecting defects in all software units becomes increasingly difficult, necessitating automated prediction to facilitate such inspection. Researchers have proposed numerous studies and techniques to predict the most defective software units at different granularity levels, such as the file level, method level, or system level. However, there is little work investigating package-level defect prediction, which provides useful granularity—finer than the system level but coarser than the file or method level—allowing for the targeting of a logical group of code that aligns with features and thereby enabling the identification of issues in specific features. In addition, packages encapsulate logical functionality and are often developed by particular teams, so focusing on package-level defect prediction can provide valuable insights regarding defective designs or implementations within a system. This paper aims to address this gap by developing package-level defect prediction models. To proceed with the study, the authors first traversed a project’s source code to extract all its packages, then calculated code metrics for each identified package and labeled them as either defective or not defective based on the feature’s defectiveness calculated from a project’s bug data. To address the difficulty caused by noisy or redundant independent variables in each dataset, they leveraged the CFS method to select an appropriate set of code metrics for each dataset. Using the selected code metrics as input attributes, seven machine-learning algorithms were applied to build defect prediction models at the package level. Based on evaluation analyses of twenty open-source projects with 6,536 identified packages, the study demonstrated that by using machine learning techniques and an appropriate set of code metrics, effective models for predicting defective packages can be built. However, different projects may require different sets of code metrics as input attributes for their prediction models. The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the background and related works, Section 3 describes the design of the empirical study, Section 4 presents the evaluation methods, analysis, and results, Section 5 discusses threats to the validity of the work, and Section 6 concludes. In summary, the study shows that machine-learning models can deliver reliable package-level defect predictions to guide testing and quality improvement efforts, though the predictive attribute subsets should be customized by careful attribute selection, as demonstrated by the experiments conducted on dozens of open-source projects",

This holds true for many African countries, including Morocco. A primary challenge for most farmers is deciding what crops to grow, as they could be more productive if they knew which crops were best suited for their location, considering its characteristics and other variables that influence yield. This paper explores the application of machine learning (ML) algorithms in developing a crop recommendation system for agriculture. The study focuses on supervised learning techniques, including Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, LightGBM, and Logistic Regression, which analyze large datasets to make predictions or decisions about new data.

        "input_text": "Data preprocessing is a tedious task that often consumes a substantial percentage of time spent on data science projects, largely due to the lack of a streamlined process. It is better described as an iterative approach, where optimal processing steps and parameters are determined through trial-and-error. The goal of data preprocessing for machine learning is to find a data representation that yields the best result, meaning the format in which the machine learning model can most effectively map the input to the output. Data scientists typically measure the effectiveness of their preprocessing by using machine learning metrics obtained during model evaluation. However, this approach has several drawbacks: as multiple data processing steps are performed, it is not always clear which ones lead to improved or deteriorated model performance. Additionally, data preprocessing is just one factor influencing machine learning metrics, alongside model and hyperparameter selection. Another challenge is that non-experts, and sometimes even professional data scientists, struggle to accurately assess the effects of their preprocessing pipelines due to the experimental nature of the model training process. Many decisions must be made in a data science project, such as which preprocessing algorithms to use, which machine learning model is suitable, and what parameters are appropriate for both preprocessing and machine learning algorithms. This can be overwhelming, especially for inexperienced individuals. The AutoML community is working to address these issues by automating not only model-specific tasks like hyperparameter optimization and neural architecture search but also data-specific tasks like data preparation and feature engineering. While these methods can help broaden the adoption of machine learning, users often lack trust in these systems due to their opacity. A study found that transparency—displaying information that may have led to automated decisions—is crucial for building trust. Another issue that necessitates evaluating data preparation is erroneous data preprocessing, such as unintentionally introducing technical bias when applying preprocessing tasks. For example, imputing missing values for the feature age with the most frequent value can create a data imbalance, which in turn can cause a technical bias in machine learning software. Making these changes more explicit can help detect such problems. For these reasons, there is a need for a transparency system in data preprocessing to provide insight into the preprocessing pipeline and enable the detection of potential problems and errors, thereby increasing trust in both automatically and manually built pipelines. A key component of this system is a tracking system that extracts metadata from data preprocessing pipelines, with an emphasis on comprehensive summaries of the data processed. This metadata is then used to create a visual presentation that facilitates the observation and assessment of the pipeline. Another idea is to allow for formal comparisons between intermediates, or data produced by preprocessing tasks. This paper provides an overview of the general approach and initial developments in this area, along with open challenges and potential solutions. Evaluating the effects of preprocessing on data and the resulting model is a crucial but often non-trivial task. In this paper, we first examined the state of the art in evaluating and debugging data preprocessing, identifying a lack of general-purpose tools that evaluate the effects of data preparation by examining the data itself. As a solution, we proposed a transparency system for data preprocessing that collects comprehensive metadata on input, intermediate, and output data, which is then used to extract information useful for data scientists in evaluating data transformations. This allows them to make informed decisions about pipeline design. A first prototype and example use case were developed as a starting point for further research. Research challenges identified include the automatic collection of metadata about the preprocessing pipeline and approaches that enable a formal and visual representation of changes in data between transformations. Another research direction could involve using transparency information extracted from the pipeline to recommend preprocessing mechanisms by comparing different preprocessing schemes based on data and change profiles generated by the proposed transparency system",

        "input_text": "Insurance is often considered uninteresting, but this work argues that insurance is a rich source of inspiration and insight for scholarship on social issues in machine learning, particularly in the field of fair machine learning. The proposal is that insurance can be viewed as an analogy to machine learning concerning social situatedness. While machine learning is a relatively recent technology, debates regarding social issues in the context of insurance have been ongoing for a long time. Both machine learning and insurance are firmly based on a statistical, probabilistic mode of reasoning, with insurance being the first commercial test of probability theory. Insurance, as a technology for managing risk, transforms uncertainty into calculable risk by sharing the risk of loss collectively, making uncertainty manageable and offsetting the effect of chance. In insurance, questions of fairness inevitably arise, centered around the tension between risk assessment and distribution. The pool of policyholders can be stratified by separating high and low-risk individuals, but the nature of this segmentation depends on risk assessment and other social considerations. Insurance is not a neutral technology, as it involves assigning responsibility, modulated by social context. The history of insurance illustrates how uncertainty, fairness, and responsibility interact and can be entangled and disentangled. From this background, conceptual insights can be extracted that apply to machine learning. The tension between risk assessment and distribution is mirrored in formal fairness principles, where actuarial fairness demands that each policyholder pays only for their own risk, while solidarity calls for equal contribution to the pool. This text problematizes actuarial fairness as a notion of fairness in the normative sense by drawing inspiration from insurance. The perspective aligns with recent proposals that stress the discrepancy between formal algorithmic fairness and substantive fairness, which some prefer to call justice. The work also emphasizes the themes of responsibility and the tensions between aggregate and individual, providing broader lessons for machine learning from insurance. The goal is to establish a general conceptual bridge between insurance and machine learning, offering a new cognitive toolkit for thinking about the social situatedness of machine learning. Fairness cannot be reduced to a formal mathematical issue; it requires broader social context, such as reasoning about responsibility. Insurance is presented as an insightful analogy, and the objective is to guide the reader through the landscape of insurance concerning social issues and establish links to machine learning. The analogy is formalized by comparing machine learning tasks with insurance tasks, where features and outcomes in machine learning correspond to policyholders' features and outcomes in insurance, with the task of setting a corresponding premium. The main claim is that insurance is an insightful analogy for the social situatedness and impact of machine learning systems. By exploring this conceptual bridge, machine learning scholars can benefit from the rich interdisciplinary literature on insurance, particularly regarding responsibility, causality, and control. The text highlights problems with actuarial fairness and suggests moving beyond formal fairness to substantive fairness, arguing that accurate predictive models do not necessarily equate to fairness. While the focus is on social issues, there are also technical lessons that machine learning can learn from insurance, such as handling uncertainty, dataset shift, and model ambiguity. The increasing use of machine learning in insurance suggests a potentially fruitful two-way interaction between these fields",
        "target_summary": "This study argues that insurance offers valuable insights for fair machine learning, highlighting parallels between the two fields in their use of statistical reasoning and handling of uncertainty.

The paper proposes using concepts from insurance, such as actuarial fairness and solidarity, to inform machine learning's approach to fairness. By establishing a conceptual bridge between the two fields, the study suggests that lessons from insurance can help address the social and technical challenges in machine learning systems."

        "input_text": "Machine learning is the driving force behind the rapid growth of modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology, leading to increasingly complex tasks and models, particularly in areas like natural language processing. As both models and training datasets grow in size, there is a growing reliance on distributed methodologies, commonly referred to as distributed machine learning, where the training procedure is fragmented into simpler sub-tasks distributed across different machines or nodes. These nodes perform their tasks in parallel and coordinate either through a server (server-based coordination, such as federated learning) or by interacting directly with each other (peer-to-peer coordination). Distributed Stochastic Gradient Descent (D-SGD) is a key distributed machine learning algorithm that divides the computational workload across nodes, making the training of large complex models more manageable. Additionally, distributed machine learning algorithms provide nodes with some level of sovereignty over their training datasets, which has helped propel this field to the forefront of machine learning and AI research in both industry and academia. A new perspective on the problem of Byzantine machine learning has been introduced, aiming to standardize the evaluation of different solutions by presenting a clear view of the merits and limitations of existing approaches. This evaluation system is generic and can be used to assess other methods not explicitly considered in the article. The ideal solution to Byzantine machine learning should tolerate up to half of the Byzantine nodes, ensure a training loss that matches the established lower bound, and have minimal overhead on gradient computations. As the number of nodes increases, it is expected that there will be larger speed differences between the fastest and slowest machines in the system",

        "input_text": "Machine Learning (ML) has rapidly become a central part of our lives, with applications ranging from traffic prediction and virtual assistants to automated radiology and autonomous vehicles. The performance of ML models depends heavily on the availability of large quantities of training data. However, in many applications, data is scattered across multiple parties that may be reluctant to share their information due to reasons like commercial competition, privacy concerns, and legal constraints. To address this, methods have been developed to allow multiple parties to collaboratively train ML models while preserving privacy, referred to as Private Collaborative Machine Learning (PCML). These methods, which fall under various research domains like privacy-preserving data mining, privacy-preserving ML, collaborative ML, and federated ML, mainly take two approaches: perturbation, which incorporates noise to obscure sensitive information, and secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC), which applies cryptographic techniques to perform joint computations without exposing private data. Despite these advancements, the fairness of such algorithms has been overlooked, even though fairness is critical in applications where automated decisions impact people’s lives, such as in criminal justice. This article introduces a new learning setting similar to PCML, with an added requirement for fairness in the learned model. To address this, a privacy-preserving pre-process mechanism is proposed to enhance the fairness of collaborative ML algorithms by decreasing distances between the distributions of attributes of privileged and unprivileged groups. This method, designed for use with any PCML algorithm, was evaluated extensively on real-world datasets, showing considerable improvements in fairness with minimal compromise in accuracy.

Finding an optimal or near-optimal solution requires predicting how well each device will handle specific workloads so that the load can be balanced and well matched to the corresponding device. Automated storage delivery tools, such as Ergastulum, rely on efficient and accurate device models to make such decisions. This article introduces a black box approach through machine learning methods to overcome this obstacle. Black box means that the model and model generation system do not store information about internal components or algorithms on the device. By giving the device some training time, the model generation system learns the behavior of the device, similar to a function of taking the workload as input. This article uses machine learning-related algorithms to establish a prediction model and compares the differences in the effectiveness of several machine learning algorithms. On this basis, it proposes the lastdelay attribute, which could play an important role in IO performance prediction on HDDs and is verified through the algorithm for attribute selection. It is considered that the distance attribute is not applicable when performing IO performance prediction on SSDs. Different tracks should use different metrics, which is proven by the experiment and requires specific analysis on a case-by-case basis. In this paper, lastdelay is added to the base of traditional attributes and performs better in predicting IO performance on disk, while the SSD is not fixed. If the distance is removed from traditional metrics on SSDs, a general conclusion is not reached, highlighting the need to analyze specific issues and select metrics accordingly. Different algorithms are compared, and in terms of predicted RMSE, RF outperforms GBDT, with the Friedman test showing no significant difference. In terms of efficiency, random gradient descent outperforms RF, CART, and GBDT. Compared to the CART algorithm, C45 has similar classification accuracy but is faster. In terms of speed, C45 outperforms CART and NB. There is no significant difference between ID3 and NB algorithms through cross-validation tests. In terms of RMSE, RF, GBDT, and CART outperform multiple linear regression. For IO performance prediction, using non-linear regression is better than linear regression",

        "input_text": "Embeddings, such as graph embeddings, are commonly used to transform complex structures into suitable inputs for machine learning algorithms. However, obtaining embeddings for large inputs can be time-consuming, making them unsuitable for on-the-fly generation. This work outlines considerations for making embeddings shareable so they can be periodically generated and released to the public. To provide self-contained access control over an embedding’s data, the study explores the application of attribute-based encryption. In the context of the funded research project CRYPTO4GRAPH-AI, the potential applicability of this scheme to distribute insights about supply chains is being explored. In machine learning, an embedding generally maps an input from an object space to a multi-dimensional vector, which is then used as input for further machine learning algorithms. This approach allows the application of established methods for machine-learning-based similarity assessment between objects if the embedding sufficiently captures this similarity. The focus is on graph embeddings, which take a graph and target dimensionality as input and can return a set of vectors, such as one vector per node or edge. Ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption is discussed, where a user can encrypt data with inherent access control over a set of preassigned attributes, and decryption is only possible if the user’s attributes match the specified policy. This work outlines the potential for creating shareable machine-learning embeddings protected by attribute-based encryption before their release, and the concept will be further explored in the CRYPTO4GRAPH-AI project.",

        "input_text": "In 2017, Uber announced Michelangelo, a platform that creates and manages data for training and inference for their machine learning (ML) models, significantly reducing the time required to put and maintain ML models in production. Michelangelo introduced their feature store, Palette, as a new class of data platform providing high-performance read and write of feature data for various workloads, from feature engineering to model training to model inference. Palette is a dual-database system, with historical feature data stored in a data warehouse and the latest feature data used by online models stored in a key-value store. All existing commercial and open-source feature stores follow this dual-database architecture, as no single Hybrid Transaction/Analytical Processing (HTAP) database has yet been shown to handle the high throughput, low latency workloads required by online models, such as personalized recommendations, along with the massive data volumes and high read bandwidth needed for training models. Feature centralization, governance, security, search, and reuse are core capabilities of feature stores. Facebook reported that in their feature store, most features are used by many models, with the most popular 100 features reused in over 100 different models. The benefits of feature reuse include higher quality features through increased usage and scrutiny, reduced storage costs, and reduced feature development and operational costs, as models that reuse features do not require new feature pipelines. This paper introduces the Hopsworks Feature Store, a highly available data platform for managing feature data for ML, supporting a mix of transactional, point-in-time analytical, and semantic search queries. Hopsworks Feature Store addresses data challenges in building ML systems and its contributions include support for collaborative development of ML systems based on centralized, governed access to feature data, a unified architecture for ML systems as feature, training, and inference pipelines, feature reuse across multiple models, support for multiple feature computation frameworks (batch, streaming, and request-time computation) based on feature freshness needs, a new taxonomy for data transformations based on the type of feature they compute (reusable, model-dependent, and request-time features), a query model for creating training data without future data leakage using AsOf Left joins, a query service that outperforms publicly accessible managed feature stores in public clouds, a query model for reading precomputed features for online inference as parallel Left joins, and a query model for finding similar features using vector embeddings. Challenges include support for mixed columnar and row-oriented workloads with high throughput batch reads of feature data and low latency reads for online inference. To address these challenges, Hopsworks was built with a dual-database architecture, with HopsFS S3 and/or external data warehouses as the column store (offline store) and RonDB as the row store (online store). Hopsworks also has a vector database to enable similarity search, a common ML workload. Hopsworks was the first open-source feature store and currently has thousands of users, with customers storing over a petabyte of data on a single Hopsworks cluster. Hopsworks Feature Store is a DBMS for ML that enables ML systems to be structured as independent feature, training, and inference pipelines. It introduces a taxonomy for data transformations (reusable, model-specific, and on-demand features) and supports those transformations as UDFs in different ML pipelines. Hopsworks also introduced a query model for reading training data (AsOf Left joins) and online features (parallel Left joins), along with performance optimizations for reading feature data from the offline store and pushdown optimizations for the online store. The next steps for Hopsworks and the feature store community involve further integrating Python with Data Warehouses/Lakehouses and supporting real-time ML systems",

        "input_text": "Machine Learning (ML) systems have seen tremendous growth over the years with increasing applications in healthcare, transportation, and finance, emerging as a cornerstone of technological advancement. This evolution is intricately linked to advancements in deep neural network technologies, increased data availability, and enhanced access to computational resources, collectively forming the foundation for the evolution of ML systems. These pivotal elements enhance the capabilities and adaptability of ML systems, empowering them to effectively address complex problems across various domains. The dynamic nature of data and operational environments adds to the unique complexity of ML systems, necessitating models to be adaptable and robust against changing conditions and requirements. Thus, practitioners need to effectively manage their ML models throughout their lifecycle as it directly impacts the performance and reliability of ML models. In the literature, model management is defined as the process of tracking a model in all phases of its lifecycle. This includes the initial development, where the model architecture and parameters are set; the training phase, which involves data handling and parameter tuning; deployment, where the model is integrated into its application environment; and monitoring and updating post-deployment. Specifically, this process involves tracking changes in model architecture, data sets, training parameters, performance metrics, and operational integration to effectively manage and optimize the model’s reliability and performance. However, prior work shows that organizations and practitioners often resort to ad hoc methods to implement the processes of model management, which can lead to inefficiencies and decreased reliability. This not only creates logistical challenges but also poses risks in terms of model performance and applicability in real world scenarios. For example, inadequate model monitoring and updating procedures may result in inaccurate predictions or suboptimal outcomes, highlighting the importance of robust model management. To the best of our knowledge, previous studies have not specifically discussed the tasks associated with model management. Identifying these tasks is essential to ensure that team members across different projects have a shared understanding of their responsibilities and workflows, ultimately improving model performance and reducing maintenance costs. In their extensive review of existing literature, Nahar et al. emphasize the need for a structured approach to model management. They argue that a clear definition of the activities, processes, and techniques involved in model management is crucial. This view is supported by Vartak et al., who define model management as the process of tracking a model in all phases of its lifecycle. The authors propose a tool to automate the processes of model management, focusing mainly on the implementation of the tool, keeping the decision-making and practical processes of model management black-box. To address this gap and guide practitioners in effectively managing their models throughout the lifecycle, we build a taxonomy for model management activities. To achieve this, we mine commit messages and issues for 227 MLrepositories from GitHub. Then we analyze and categorize various activities involved in model management and link them to specific challenges. To further enrich our findings, we conducted a survey with 21 practitioners from industry and academia, from which we observed a significant trend towards the automation of ML pipelines. Our work aims to address the following research questions: What are the activities of machine learning model management? We find six unique categories of model management activities, namely maintenance, development, environment, experimentation, data engineering, and deployment. Moreover, our findings indicate that a significant 57.9% of these activities fall under the maintenance category. This category encompasses tasks such as refactoring, documentation, bug fixing, and testing. Such a predominance of maintenance activities aligns with the dynamic nature of MLsystems, which constantly need to adapt to changing data and requirements. What are the challenges of machine learning model management? Our study reveals 12 unique challenges of model management encompassing areas such as documentation maintenance, bug management, compatibility and dependency issues, and implementation difficulties. Notably, 15.3% of these challenges are associated with documentation maintenance. This is closely trailed by bug management at 14.9% and compatibility issues at 12.9%. These findings suggest that practitioners often struggle with keeping documentation up-to-date and consistent with the frequent changes models are through. How can machine learning model management challenges be mitigated? Our survey results show a clear inclination among participants (47.6%) towards adopting tools (e.g., DVC) that enable versioning of models, data, and documentation. Additionally, 66.7% of respondents emphasize the importance of replicability by utilizing virtual environments and container technologies. Contributions. In addition, to provide practitioners with a practical reference to efficiently allocate their efforts and resources, we analyze the complexity of model management activities using the time it takes to resolve issues. We believe that our study will assist practitioners in developing and managing models reliably and make the following contributions: We provide a taxonomy of 16 ML model management activities. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that provides a taxonomy of model management and its associated activities. We identify 12 unique challenges of model management that we map to model management activities. We conduct a survey with practitioners and provide practical insights into mitigating model management challenges. We provide a set of actionable recommendations based on our findings and experience in conducting this study for practitioners to guide them in managing their ML models. Based on our findings, we provide a definition of model management processes. We make our labeled data set of model management activities and challenges publicly available. Paper Organization. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes our methodology. Section 3 presents the findings of our three research questions. Section 4 discusses the implications of our findings. Section 5 discusses related work. Section 6 outlines the threats to the validity of our study. Section 7 concludes this paper. In this work, we presented an extensive investigation into the management of ML models, identifying key activities and challenges in this domain. Our analysis, grounded in the manual inspection and labeling of the commits of 227 ML repositories, reveals the dynamic nature of model management and underscores the necessity for standardized practices in this field, especially in collaborative settings. We proposed a taxonomy of 16 model management activities, which offers clarity and structure to a field that has, until now, largely relied on ad hoc approaches. This taxonomy, curated from analyzing real-world projects, provides a framework that can be applied in both academic and industrial contexts for the effective management of ML models. Our findings also highlight the growing need for automating the ML pipeline, particularly emphasizing the importance of versioning for data, models, and documentation. In line with this, we observed a significant focus on replicability, with participants in our survey shedding light on the value of virtual environments and containers in achieving consistent and reliable ML model management and deployment. Based on our observations, we make several recommendations, notably that when using collaborative platforms such as GitHub, developers should keep their commits atomic and push changes more incrementally, allowing for more reproducible models. Recognizing the connection of ML model management with broader ML software management, future work should also explore the evolution and management of ML components within software systems to extend our taxonomy to cover these aspects. Furthermore, we plan (and encourage others) to develop approaches and tools to automate the model management pipeline and enable better monitoring of model changes within collaborative platforms. This is important because understanding the connection between model management and broader software management can lead to more comprehensive and effective strategies for maintaining ML systems. Our study is the first step toward achieving this, laying the groundwork for future research and development in this area",
