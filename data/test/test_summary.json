        "input_text": "One of the first and most important implementations of information technology in medicine is the replacement of the traditional paper-based documentation of medical data with digitized files, resulting in the creation of a vast repository of digital information that is constantly growing. The combination of an aging population and nursing staff shortages implies the need for more advanced systems in the healthcare industry. Many key enablers for the optimization of healthcare systems require provisioning of location awareness for patients (e.g., with dementia), nurses, doctors, assets, etc. Therefore, many Indoor Positioning Systems (IPSs) will be indispensable in healthcare systems. Localization, with an expected 4.4 billion market in 2019, is one of the main pillars for indoor services. Most of the newest applications need to know the user's location to customize their services, monitor people, or track Internet-of-Things objects, among others. Moreover, the location can also be used for detecting the user's activities and to provide services based on their location. Concurrently, Machine Learning is a vastly growing domain that enables learning and decision-making through the analysis and processing of an immense amount of data. Several ML algorithms have been implemented for healthcare purposes, improving the standard of living of thousands of people. There has already been a lot of published work about algorithms focusing on the field of diagnosis or the prediction of epidemics. Furthermore, there is strong evidence suggesting that machine learning methods and applications can have a significant impact not only on the quality but also on the cost of health care services. On the other hand, it is important to take into account the fact that the healthcare sector, and especially the part that involves medical data, presents a number of peculiarities. As a result, there is a delay in estimating the effect of ML implementations, compared to other domains. The most crucial aspects that could impede the application of ML algorithms and need to be addressed by interventions similar to MODELHealth are: The disinclination of the Electronic Health Records (EHR) owners to provide access to medical data for secondary purposes, because of medical privacy and confidentiality. Although there have been numerous studies about anonymization techniques in health data and Electronic Health Records (EHR), there are still weaknesses that may arise during their implementation. Thus, data owners cannot be efficiently convinced to take this responsibility. A crucial section of the MODELHealth project is the research, the standardization, and the automation of anonymization of EHR data. The difficulty of integrating the required structures for the efficient use of existing algorithms, without increasing the cost and the complexity to an undesirable extent. Health science is a complex and multifactorial field where causality relationships are not always easily discernible, which should be taken into account when applying ML algorithms. Consequently, the same precision cannot be achieved when an algorithm has been trained on a dataset and then is applied to data of patients with different demographic profiles; thus, often, retraining of the algorithms in the new context is warranted. Nevertheless, the infrastructure that the retraining process requires can be of high cost and complexity. MODELHealth focuses on the development of a “plug and play” platform that will provide the required infrastructure, without expecting the association with the technical complexity by those involved. ML algorithms are difficult to be efficiently implemented and reused when medical data are derived from numerous heterogeneous sources. For instance, a diverse number of databases, storage schemes, and units of measurements may be used by each provider. One essential objective of the project is the creation of an Ontological Scheme that transforms health data into a universal form. This will discharge the process of algorithm development from the environment and the data storage format, enabling their reuse in any environment with the same Ontological Scheme. Considering the characteristics described above, an innovative software platform, enabling the development of an environment for big data exploitation is proposed in MODELHealth. The project offers an end-to-end solution including the procedures of pumping, anonymizing, and enriching heterogeneous data from various health units and providers, processing and implementation of ML techniques to develop stochastic forecasting or classification algorithms, mainly based on artificial neural networks (Artificial Neural Networks-ANN's), and provision of functional versions of these algorithms to authorized information systems through parametric web services. In the healthcare sector, the collaboration between industry and academic/research partners is crucial as it can address a diachronic need: Bridging the gap between research results and their practical application. It has been declared that: Machine learning offers a cornucopia of useful ways to approach problems that otherwise defy manual solution. However, much current ML research suffers from a growing detachment from those real problems. Many investigators withdraw into their private studies with a copy of the dataset and work in isolation to perfect algorithmic performance. Publishing results to the ML community is the end of the process. Successes usually are not communicated back to the original problem setting, or not in a form that can be used. ML methods in the health sector will provide solutions to real-world problems only if they are designed for real environment implementations. The development of the MODELHealth platform aims at the creation of the mechanisms and infrastructures that will enable the application of health-related ML algorithms in real environments with maximum efficiency and minimum cost. The project focuses on the implementation of ML in the demanding field of health, aspiring to reduce its research requirements essentially. When the project is completed, the implementation and spreading of the use of ML techniques in health data will be facilitated. The ultimate goal of the proposed intervention is the enhancement of the quality of the services provided as well as of the working conditions of healthcare professionals while reducing the total cost. MODELHealth, following a holistic approach for the implementation of ML processes, is an integrated platform that provides a health organization the ability not only to use existing research results but also to carry out its own research at the minimum cost. In addition to the flexibility and cost advantage of cloud infrastructure, provided as a subscription-based service, MODELHealth aspires to be an attractive solution, in terms of quality and cost efficiency.",

        "input_text": "Crude oil is one of the most important fuel sources on the planet, accounting for more than a third of global energy use in the past. Crude oil is a key factor in balancing import and export for many countries due to its importance as a source of energy. Crude oil price shocks have a significant impact on aggregate macroeconomic indices like GDP, interest rates, investment, inflation, unemployment, and currency rates, according to empirical evidence. The economic impact of oil price changes is asymmetrical, meaning the negative impact of higher oil prices is greater than the beneficial impact of lower oil prices. Even a minor price rise can result in significant losses. According to studies, a 10% increase in oil prices equates to 0.6 to 2.5 percent GDP growth in the United States. Therefore, it has become crucial for researchers and economists alike to have a fair idea of swings in crude oil price. To predict the crude oil price, researchers have proposed various predictive techniques in the past. In the recent past, machine learning (ML) techniques have taken precedence over traditional econometric techniques. Some of the reasons for the growing popularity of ML in energy economics can be found in a comparison of its properties to those of traditional econometric models (e.g., ARIMA and GARCH). The advantage of machine learning algorithms over traditional statistics/econometrics methods is that they can handle enormous amounts of structured and unstructured data and produce quick conclusions or forecasts. They operate on non-parametric assumptions. In the proposed model, the researchers have focused on three econometric factors like CPI, GDP, and Gold Prices (USD) to predict the crude oil price. Overall, six machine learning models namely Linear Regression, CART, Generalized Linear Model, ARIMA, ARIMAX, and VAR are used to predict the crude oil price. The yearly data has been used for the experiment ranging from 1978 to 2020. From the results obtained through the experiment, it has been proven that traditional models like ARIMAX could efficiently predict the correct crude oil price from the other independent variables. The performance of the models could be significantly improved after applying feature engineering techniques. The ARIMA and VAR models have been used to further forecast the crude oil price for five years ahead. The result of the ARIMA model shows a downtrend for the upcoming years, which has been accepted by the researchers considering the predictive efficiency of the models under study. The further research paper contains related research work by other researchers in section II, followed by the philosophical underpinning of the research in section III. Section IV describes the research methodology followed by the results and observations in section V. Finally, section VI concludes the research work by suggesting further research opportunities for the reader. The current research is aimed at understanding the impact of various macroeconomic factors like GDP, CPI, and US Dollar on crude oil prices, which is a key factor in balancing import and export for many countries due to its importance as a source of energy. Various regression models are implemented to predict crude oil prices, among which the ARMAX has shown the lowest RMSE and highest accuracy of the predictions. The US Dollar and CPI have been observed as showing the highest impact on the crude oil price. Considering the prediction accuracy, ARIMA models results are recommended to forecast the crude oil price for five years ahead. As per the ARIMA model, the crude oil price will go down in the upcoming years, which may affect the investments of investors investing in crude oil. In the future, the current work can be enhanced by considering more macroeconomic variables like supply and demand levels, the impact of GDP, COVID-19, OPEC reserves, YEN/USD, Euro/USD, and crude oil properties for model selection and applying deep learning like CNN & ANN or a hybrid of econometrics and deep learning models to capture nonlinear trends.",

        "input_text": "A single piece of text may contain one or more emotions. A single-label emotion classification task aims to predict only one emotion of a text. The main drawback of single-label emotion classification is that it only captures one emotion in a given text, making it difficult to completely understand the author's emotional state. Multi-label emotion classification overcomes this limitation by capturing all possible emotions in a given text. Consequently, we can make a more accurate judgment about the emotional state of an author. Multi-label emotion classification has potential applications in various domains. For example, in E-learning, multi-label emotion classification can adjust the learning techniques in conformity with the learner. Multi-label emotion classification can be helpful in health care to determine the feelings and comfort level of the patient towards the treatment. Multi-label emotion classification can be used, for example, in stock market monitoring or prioritizing calls in a call center. In general, code-mixing can be characterized as the use of two or more languages at the same time. According to studies, more than 50% of Europeans use another language besides their mother language. The internet is the most prominent source in promoting global, linguistic code-mixed culture. In the South Asian community, particularly in Pakistan, code-mixed (English and Roman Urdu) text has become a preferable script for Facebook comments/posts, tweets, and daily communication using SMS messages. It can be noted from these studies that the use of code-mixed digital text is increasing. Thus, there is a need to develop standard evaluation resources and methods for code-mixed texts for various applications, such as author profiling, sentiment analysis, emotion analysis, etc. Standard evaluation resources are needed to develop, evaluate, and compare multi-label emotion classification methods. Previous studies have developed few corpora for multi-label emotion classification using English tweets (monolingual). However, the problem of multi-label emotion classification is not explored for code-mixed (say, English and Roman Urdu) texts. To fulfill this research gap, the present study aims to develop a large benchmark code-mixed (English and Roman Urdu) corpus for the multi-label emotion classification task and evaluate it. The two main objectives of this study are: (1) to develop a large benchmark code-mixed (English and Roman Urdu) SMS messages corpus for the multi-label emotion classification task and (2) to apply, evaluate, and compare state-of-the-art classical machine learning, deep learning, and transfer learning methods on the proposed corpus to investigate the most suitable methods for multi-label emotion classification on a code-mixed corpus. For the first objective, we developed a large benchmark multi-label emotion classification corpus, which contains 11,914 code-mixed (English and Roman Urdu) multi-label SMS messages, hereafter called CM-MEC-21 corpus. In the CM-MEC-21 corpus, each code-mixed SMS message is manually annotated from a predefined set of 12 emotions, which are: anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, love, optimism, pessimism, sadness, surprise, trust, and neutral (no emotion). For the second objective, we developed and applied state-of-the-art classical machine learning, deep learning, and transfer learning methods on our proposed CM-MEC-21 corpus. We believe that our proposed CM-MEC-21 corpus will be helpful for (1) the promotion of research in an under-resourced language, i.e., Roman Urdu, (2) the development of bi-lingual dictionaries for English and Roman Urdu languages, (3) carrying out a detailed comparison of existing methods for the multi-label emotion classification task, and (4) the development and evaluation of new methods for multi-label emotion classification on code-mixed text (in our case, English and Roman Urdu). The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section II describes the existing multi-label emotion classification corpora and methods. Section III presents the corpus compilation process used to create the proposed corpus. Section IV describes methods for the multi-label emotion classification task. Section V presents the experimental setup (dataset, techniques, evaluation methodology, and evaluation measures). Results and their analysis are presented in Section VI. Finally, Section VII concludes the paper and discusses potential avenues for future work. Code-mixed (English and Roman Urdu) text is widely used, especially in the South Asian community. However, it is not explored for the multi-label emotion classification problem. As described in this paper, our novel contribution is a newly developed and publicly available benchmark code-mixed and multi-label SMS messages-based corpus for the multi-label emotion classification task. The corpus consists of 11,914 code-mixed multi-label SMS messages manually annotated for the presence/absence of the following 12 emotions: anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, love, optimism, pessimism, sadness, surprise, trust, and neutral (no emotion). In addition to dataset creation, we applied state-of-the-art machine learning (content-based 3-word n-gram features and eight character n-gram features), deep learning, and transfer learning-based methods for the multi-label emotion classification task on our proposed CM-MEC-21 corpus. The best results were obtained using state-of-the-art machine learning methods with word uni-gram (Micro F1 D 0.67) and OVR multi-label machine learning algorithm when training on code-mixed (Train-CM-CM-MEC-21) and testing by combining code-mixed, Roman Urdu, and English (Test-CM-CM-MEC-21 and Test-E-CM-MEC-21 and Test-RUCM-MEC-21) multi-label SMS messages. In the future, we plan to apply other transfer learning-based models such as RoBERTa, DistilBERT, etc., to our proposed corpus. An ensemble of the model would be considered to increase classification performance.",

        "input_text": "As potential customers, people usually seek help from online portals to gain knowledge about a particular product and finally decide whether to make a purchase. It can take several hours to read all the reviews, sometimes leading to missing important ones, resulting in a wrong decision regarding the product purchase. Each product has thousands of reviews, making it tedious for customers to make a decision based on varying user opinions. To address this issue, a more well-defined and concise product review is proposed so that users do not need to skim through all the reviews, thereby saving their time and effort. As a solution to the ongoing problem that customers experience daily, automatic review summarization will be used to analyze product reviews and convert them into a user-readable, concise, and precise format. Sentiment analysis is first applied to the pre-processed text reviews, after which the sequence-to-sequence encoder-decoder along with an attention layer is used for the summarization process to ensure that the semantics of the reviews are maintained, helping to achieve the desired results. Implementing the above-mentioned techniques has yielded positive satisfactory results, which can be further improved by using a window model so the model can process entire paragraphs at a time and produce a single output for each. The model can also be trained more rigorously by providing a dataset that is summary-based rather than review-based, enabling the implementation of ROUGE and BLEU techniques to check the predicted summarys accuracy.",

        "input_text": "Machine learning (ML) has become in recent years an essential tool not only in the field of academic research but also in business and industrial applications. Due to the improvement experienced by hardware devices in recent years, an increasing number of companies in many different business areas have decided to take advantage of ML technologies to analyze the large amounts of data they need to manage. For many years, a huge research effort has been devoted to the integration of ML tools and relational database management systems (RDBMSs), either by implementing ML algorithms in RDBMSs or by implementing well-known database optimization techniques in ML tools. However, this research effort devoted to relational databases has not been reflected in the field of array databases. Taking into account that increasingly large amounts of data are generated every day, and a relevant part of them are array data, leveraging the efficiency of array databases for the analysis of array data in ML applications is essential. Therefore, the most efficient tools in array data analysis will allow users to boost analysis capabilities in many and diverse application domains such as cancer detection, pollution analysis, weather forecasting, and environmental classification. An outline of this tutorial with an estimated time duration, covering a full length of 1.5 hours, and relevant references is shown below. Moreover, a hands-on session on how to implement analytics on an array DBMS is proposed for a duration of 1.5 hours. The tutorial will cover several topics: Array data and Array DBMSs (20), providing a brief summary on the array data model and current array DBMSs; ML applications over array data (15), discussing array data in ML applications through real application examples and pointing out the main drawbacks of using non-specific array databases; Analytics on array DBMSs (25), offering an overview of expected analytics on array DBMSs with specific use cases and application examples; and ML in Array Databases (30), reviewing current leading array databases and their ML capabilities, along with implementation examples of ML algorithms. The session will conclude with a 90-minute hands-on session. Both data scientists and researchers in the broad areas of ML and databases are encouraged to attend this tutorial. Data scientists will learn about the current ML capabilities of on-production array databases and how to leverage both a specific array query language and a generic Python API. Researchers will learn about state-of-the-art contributions to the integration of ML algorithms in array databases. A basic knowledge of linear algebra, ML algorithms, and array data management is advisable. There is no specific technical requirement that limits the maximum number of participants. A tutorial at the ICDE conference will increase the importance of this topic. Top-level data scientists, as well as database and machine learning researchers, will not only learn about state-of-the-art solutions on the topic but also learn how to implement ML algorithms in current array databases. Participants will be encouraged to join the current research effort devoted to the topic, and they will notice the large number of opportunities for new research contributions and results. Several issues arise when designing and implementing ML algorithms in array databases. A key feature that allows array databases to achieve good performance is related to the efficient implementation of linear algebra operations on distributed array data. Current ML algorithms may have to perform computations on large matrices because both the training dataset matrix and the model matrix may be very large. When these matrices do not fit in main memory, both data and models need to be distributed. Fortunately, array databases can model these matrices as distributed arrays and provide efficient storage techniques. However, the efficient implementation of linear algebra operations, such as matrix multiplication, involving such distributed arrays still remains a challenging problem that deserves research efforts. One of the most important research topics is related to the declarative specification of iterative algorithms. Currently, many array databases provide SQL-based query languages but do not provide constructs for implementing FOR loops. But even if they were provided, their execution would not be efficient. Thus, constructs for the declarative specification of such iteration algorithms in provided query languages are required.",

        "input_text": "For any Internet of Things (IoT) and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) framework, sensors are the fundamental devices for generating data. They are responsible for sensing, processing, and storing data, which are crucial for many decision-making policies. Therefore, the reliability of any data is of utmost importance in any application. However, sensors have limited resources and capabilities, which often make the data generated by them unreliable and inaccurate. These sensors are typically battery-operated, and when their batteries are replenished, the likelihood of generating erroneous data increases significantly. Additionally, environmental effects play a major role in the operation of the sensor nodes. Whether in IoT or WSN, the primary goal is data communication between devices without any human intervention, making sensors susceptible to malicious attacks where data can be exploited by adversaries. All these factors contribute to the unreliability of sensor data, ultimately influencing the final decision-making process. Consequently, outliers can be considered a critical factor that affects data quality. Any field concerned with data collection, such as weather monitoring, fraud and intrusion detection, sensor faults in heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, traffic anomaly detection, etc., is significantly impacted by outliers. In recent times, machine learning has proven to be a very powerful method for detecting outliers in sensor data. This brief survey outlines some of the works that have addressed the issue of outlier detection using machine learning techniques. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II presents the basics of outliers in IoT and WSN. Section III provides a summary of the different machine learning techniques used for detecting outliers in IoT and WSN, followed by Section IV, which highlights the important research areas that need further focus. Finally, Section V concludes the paper. In this work, various machine learning techniques for detecting outliers in IoT and WSN have been described. In IoT and WSN frameworks, sensors are the core devices for generating raw data and are also responsible for detecting environmental changes. Therefore, detecting outliers is essential to ensure error-free data generated from sensors. Some works have also been tabulated, which are useful in detecting various kinds of outliers in sensor data. From the discussion, it is evident that classification methods are the most extensively used learning methods for detecting outliers in IoT and WSN. The existing shortcomings in both IoT and WSN highlight the need for developing more suitable outlier detection techniques for both univariate and multivariate data. Additionally, while developing new machine learning methods, factors such as the mobility of nodes and changes in network topology should be seriously considered.",

        "input_text": "Urban land cover classification plays a crucial role in understanding the advancement of urban environments and their impact on the ecosystem, resource management, and urban planning. Remote sensing data, obtained from satellites or other aerial platforms, provides valuable information about the earths surface for detailed analysis, monitoring, and detection. This data is essential for accurately mapping and monitoring urban land cover, which is a crucial resource for urban management and planning. High-resolution aerial or satellite imagery can be used to derive this information, which has various applications including mapping green spaces, impervious surfaces, and updating building footprints. Geographic Information System (GIS) data has been widely used for land-based sustainability analysis. However, extracting accurate land cover information from high-resolution data is a complex task. The high degree of spectral variability within land cover classes, caused by factors such as the angle of the sun, gaps in tree canopies, and shadows, can significantly reduce the accuracy of traditional pixel-based image classification methods. This issue arises due to the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP), which causes a mismatch between pixels and real-world objects of interest.This paper aims to explore the challenges and techniques involved in extracting urban land cover information from high-resolution data, with a focus on addressing the MAUP. It also investigates the potential of new techniques such as object-based image analysis (OBIA) and machine learning algorithms in improving classification accuracy. Extracting land cover information from remote sensing images is challenging due to the arbitrary size of pixels, making it difficult to correlate them with real-world objects. To tackle this problem, the approach of Geospatial object-based image analysis has been used in several studies. The OBIA approach segments the image into homogeneous regions before classification, and the attributes of these segments are used for classification instead of single pixels. This approach helps reduce within-class spectral variability, incorporates spatial and contextual information, and reduces the sensitivity of classification to the MAUP. For this research, the aim is to develop a machine learning approach for the prediction of urban land cover using the Urban Land Cover dataset. Various machine learning algorithms will be explored for classification, including Decision Tree classifier, Random Forest classifier, XGBoost classifier, Ridge classifier, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier, to identify the most accurate and efficient method for urban land cover classification. The goal is to develop an accurate land cover classification model that can be deployed in practical applications such as resource management, environmental monitoring, and urban planning. The results of this study will contribute to the body of knowledge in the field of urban land cover classification using remote sensing and machine learning and may have applications in decision-making, sustainability, and urban management. The study produced observations that are detailed in Table 1, which contains the accuracy and a comprehensive exploration of various classification algorithms, each bringing distinct attributes to the forefront. A meticulous evaluation of these classifiers was performed across differing feature selections, revealing unique accuracy scores associated with each. Ultimately, the study concludes that the Random Forest classification algorithm emerges as the most effective choice for the model. Characterized by its ensemble learning technique and the amalgamation of multiple decision trees, Random Forest leverages the majority vote of these trees for accurate class prediction. To optimize its performance, the study employs Grid Search CV, a crucial technique in machine learning for systematically fine-tuning hyperparameters to achieve optimal performance. This technique helps in finding the best hyperparameters for the machine learning model, enhancing the models fit to the dataset. In this paper, different machine learning algorithms were used for urban land cover classification, and it was found that Random Forest achieved the best performance. The exploration of different feature selection methods revealed that the best results are obtained by using all the features, as each provides important insights into the spectral, textural, size, and shape of the land cover. The results clearly suggest that machine learning is a promising approach for urban land cover classification, with Random Forests achieving high accuracy and being relatively insensitive to noise. The use of spectral and spatial features can further improve classification accuracy.",

        "input_text": "According to World Health Organization reports, approximately 3.8 million men and 3.4 million women worldwide die each year due to Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), a leading cause of cardiovascular mortality globally. Two-thirds of patients die even before reaching the hospital. Clinically, CAD may either remain asymptomatic for a long period or manifest as life-threatening Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS). Coronary Angiography (CAG), a gold standard investigation for the definitive diagnosis of CAD, requires well-equipped labs and is a costly procedure. It is also challenging to identify genuine patients for CAG referrals at the primary point of contact, especially when patient load is high and quick decision-making is required. CAG referrals are based on scores from ACS triage tools at emergency departments, while screening tests like exercise stress tests and stress echocardiography are used at secondary care centers. Unfortunately, these tests have known limitations, contraindications, and moderate sensitivities. Some limitations include the high cost of devices used for stress tests and the limited availability of professionals with expertise in interpreting the results of these tests. Therefore, it is important to develop a screening tool for predicting CAD that not only overcomes these limitations but is also cost-effective and easy to use even at the first point of contact. There has been an indication of an association between Electrocardiography (ECG), a measurement of electrical activity in the heart, and CAD. Being non-invasive, low-cost, and widely available, using ECG to develop a promising screening tool merits research. However, the wide inter- and intra-individual variations in ECG records of patients make it challenging to effectively use ECG data to screen CAD patients. With the upsurge of applications of statistical machine learning and deep learning in healthcare over the past few years, multiple studies have attempted to predict CAD with various biomarkers such as Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and genetic variations. The aim of the present study is to explore the utility of ECG as a screening tool for CAD. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces previous work on CAD prediction and detection. Section 3 provides our data collection process. Section 4 presents the methodology of our study, which is divided into two parts: Feature Extraction/Selection and the application of machine learning algorithms for CAD prediction using these features. Section 5 lists the results obtained using algorithms developed in Section 4. In Section 6, we discuss our conclusions. In comparison to other studies, our results have wider clinical applicability. In a study conducted by other researchers, the best predictor model was based on a Random Forest Classifier using HRV measured from 24-hour ECG in hypertensive patients, showing sensitivity and specificity of 71.4% and 87.8%, respectively. However, recording a 24-hour ECG is an impractical choice if screening for CAG has to be done at the first point of contact. Another study developed a multi-parametric measure for classifying normal subjects from patients suffering from two types of CAD, i.e., Angina Pectoris (AP) and Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS), obtaining accuracies of 75.0%, 72.5%, and 84.6% for control, AP, and ACS groups, respectively. Additionally, some researchers used a multilayer perceptron on HRV indices and achieved the highest classification accuracy of 89.5% for CAD prediction. However, these studies had small sample sizes, and controlled recording conditions, making their real-life utility unclear. Moreover, many studies reported accuracy rather than sensitivity and specificity, weakening confidence in their clinical applicability. In our study, we obtained a specificity and sensitivity of 88.79% and 87.17% using an XGBoost Classifier. These results are superior to available screening tests such as stress tests, where specificity ranges from 70% to 80% and sensitivity from 60% to 70%. An ECG-based machine learning solution is a highly suitable and versatile screening tool. Compared to other screening and triage tests, obtaining an ECG is simple, non-invasive, and cost-effective, making it feasible to perform even at the first point of contact.",

        "input_text": "The information generated from different domains such as sports, medical, entertainment, surveillance, and bulletins is predominantly in digital format, making it challenging to store and manage this vast amount of data efficiently. Video summarization plays a crucial role in addressing this challenge by creating and presenting the highlights of a video in a condensed format, thereby facilitating easier video browsing and retrieval. This process allows users to view abstracts of lengthy videos, enabling them to extract maximum information in less time, thus streamlining the decision-making process or simply saving time for viewers. Video summarization can be categorized into two main types: static and dynamic. Static summarization involves generating a storyboard comprised of keyframes, which are selected based on their relevance to the original video content. These keyframes are the highlighted parts of the video, and the process of generating a static summary includes selecting constituent frames, extracting features, grouping frames, and skimming through keyframes. On the other hand, dynamic summarization refers to video skims, which consist of the most relevant parts or events of the input video, termed as segments. These segments include both audio and video content, and the dynamic summarization process involves video segmentation, score prediction, and segment selection. As the number of security cameras offering single or multi-view coverage increases, the amount of video data generated grows disproportionately, often containing redundant frames with little useful information. This scenario underscores the need for Multi-View Summarization (MVS) approaches to extract prominent elements from such Big Data effectively. Despite the critical need for MVS in various applications, the problem has not been sufficiently addressed in the literature, with most studies focusing on artisanal or mid-level features. Further research is recommended to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of video summarization systems, particularly in real-time applications. Embedding cutting-edge summarization technologies into systems used by contemporary news agencies could make the process more time-effective and reusable, addressing the growing demand for efficient data management in various sectors, including law enforcement, healthcare, education, surveillance, and entertainment.",

        "input_text": "With the development of society, the fragmented time in people's lives has gradually increased, leaving them with less time to read. Concurrently, most displays have become lighter and narrower, changing the way people obtain information. Under these constraints of time and space, there is an urgent need for tools that can simplify the massive amounts of information available and make Internet usage more efficient. Abstractive text summarization technology presents an effective solution to this challenge. Since the 1950s, automatic text summarization technology has evolved from initially judging sentence characteristics and weights by word frequency to using characteristic databases in the 1970s, and in the 1990s, incorporating text annotation, the Naive Bayes classifier, and the graph sorting model to apply machine learning methods to text summarization. In recent years, with the advancement of deep learning and long short-term memory networks (LSTM), significant progress has been made in the field of abstractive summarization, making it an indispensable area of study on the Internet. Abstractive summaries have a wide range of applications, including news summaries, microblogs, tweet summaries, book summaries, and story summaries, where they help in clustering news, understanding public opinion trends, and delivering content to users efficiently. Currently, deep learning methods are the primary approach used for abstractive summarization, and the particular challenges of applying these methods to Chinese text have highlighted several problems that still need to be solved. The core requirements for automatic summarization are that the summary should be short and should contain the central content of the original text. Unlike extractive methods, which involve simply extracting parts of the original text, abstractive methods require understanding the original text, fusing information, and summarizing the content in a coherent sequence. The shift to abstractive summarization has been driven by the substantial progress made through the use of deep learning neural networks in generative text summarization. Although abstractive summaries are more challenging to generate, they are often more similar to human summaries because they can include expressions not present in the original text. The deep learning-based abstractive summarization method is primarily built around the encoder-decoder framework, which is effective for short texts but may miss information in longer texts. Improvements in the encoder-decoder process, such as Attention, Distraction, Coverage, Pointer networks, and Copy mechanisms, have enhanced the accuracy of summarization results for longer texts. In Chinese text summarization, improvements focus on the preprocessing steps, such as named entity recognition and Chinese word segmentation, which help achieve summarization results comparable to English text summarization. The attention mechanism, distraction method, and pointer network enhance the encoder-decoder framework's ability to handle infrequent but significant words, making summaries more aligned with human habits. However, the evaluation process for abstractive summarization remains challenging. Current evaluation methods, while effective, are not entirely accurate because different words or phrases can be used to convey the same meaning, leading to deviations from manual summaries and lower scores. It is not advisable to directly compare scores for abstractive summaries with those for extractive summaries. Although deep learning-based generative text summarization methods have improved, the overall summary test scores remain low, and many issues, such as the significance of infrequent words, polysemy in Chinese, and specific sorting after named entity recognition, still lack better solutions. Further research and new encoder and decoder designs are needed to address these ongoing challenges.",

        "input_text": "The global positioning system (GPS), based on satellite radio navigation, provides extremely accurate outdoor positioning. However, the disadvantage of GPS is that it does not penetrate solid structures and is not applicable indoors. To address the challenge of indoor positioning, wireless sensor networks were developed, consisting of sensors such as infrared and Bluetooth. Methods in this category include TOA (Time of Arrival), AOA (Angle of Arrival), and TDOA (Time Difference of Arrival). Despite their potential, these methods did not gain wide popularity due to the high costs associated with sensor-related hardware. In contrast, the integrated Wi-Fi cards in consumer mobile phones offer a cost-efficient solution by leveraging the positioning capability of wireless local area networks (WLAN). One of the most popular methods within the WLAN positioning category is fingerprinting based on received signal strength (RSS). RSS fingerprinting is a process that gathers information on radio transmissions and identifies the transmitting device. In recent years, the fingerprint positioning method has received extensive attention from scholars and scientific researchers, becoming an important technology for solving complex environment positioning problems. As wearable devices become more mature and the Internet of Things (IoT) era advances, fingerprint positioning methods are expected to play a significant role and thus have become a hot area of research. However, existing fingerprint positioning technology is still immature, and many challenges remain. Therefore, addressing the issues in fingerprint positioning by improving algorithms and strategies is of significant importance. This research investigates and compares various machine learning methods for predicting locations based on RSS data. It introduces the recent developments in RSS technology for indoor localization and further explores the application of machine learning methods for location prediction. Wi-Fi-based RSS methods offer solutions to the challenges of indoor localization where GPS and sensor networks have been inadequate. Machine learning models used for predicting locations or coordinates generally achieve high accuracy, although the choice of specific models depends on the environmental setup. The application of RSS methods helps overcome localization difficulties in environments with obstacles. While significant improvements in accuracy can be achieved through machine learning techniques, the computational costs remain manageable with customization in environmental and device setups. The cost-benefit analysis suggests that further research in this area will be beneficial and potentially profitable for industrialization.",

        "input_text": "Asset pricing modeling that targets uncertainty and parameter instability has become a significant focus in empirical finance research over the past decade, with many studies seeking to enhance forecast accuracy in finance and economics through new methods. Combination forecasting assigns weights to different models and combines them in a linear regression to achieve better performance results, and while other effective methods have been explored, much of this research remains confined to linear regression models. As the demand for higher explanatory power grows, the use of machine learning methods has become increasingly prevalent, leading this paper to propose an empirical method that combines heterogeneous models through a novel stacking approach. In machine learning, different learners can yield varied effects when predicting the same data sample, and while previous studies have focused on optimizing single models, practical applications often reveal that no single classification or regression model provides the best prediction. Drawing on the weak learner integration theory, which suggests that varying learner performance can enhance final prediction outcomes, this paper introduces a stacking method to integrate multiple machine learning models for improved stock market predictions, offering a new combination framework for financial time series prediction. Although forecast combinations based on linear regression are widely used in economics and finance, the integration of machine learning methods remains underexplored, despite their potential for greater accuracy and flexibility. Highly parameterized models often face challenges like overfitting and parameter uncertainty, which can diminish their out-of-sample forecast abilities. To address these issues, this paper utilizes an advanced stacking combination method, building 11 different frameworks based on popular machine learning methods across various time horizons, and employing a 3-layer stacking approach to combine heterogeneous predictions for enhanced performance. The study also assesses the relative importance of each input variable and validates the robustness of the combination method. Potential improvements include expanding the data set beyond the 12 variables used in this study, which could lead to more promising results, and refining the selection of base learners to remove models that perform poorly, as these could negatively impact the stacking outcome. Ultimately, this paper presents an innovative approach to predicting stock market returns, emphasizing the value of learning from each other to improve forecast accuracy and offering a new perspective on the potential of machine learning in empirical finance research.",

        "input_text": "Lately, text summarization has gained growing significance due to the overwhelming volume of data available on the internet, which has amplified the need for robust and adaptable summarization techniques. This importance stems from its wide-ranging applications, such as summarizing newspaper articles, books, scholarly publications, and other lengthy texts, helping users quickly extract essential information. The challenge of accessing and assimilating this vast amount of information has become a continual focal point of research, as manually condensing these texts is labor-intensive. Automation, supported by advances in machine learning and deep learning, has introduced numerous advantages, with techniques like extractive and abstractive summarization at the forefront. Extractive summarization involves selecting key sentences or phrases directly from the source text, while abstractive summarization aims to generate concise summaries by understanding and rephrasing the original content. The latter is more efficient and aligns closely with human-like summarization, as it can craft new sentences and condense complex information into a coherent narrative. However, abstractive summarization, particularly with state-of-the-art models like BERT, requires substantial computational resources, which can be a limitation for researchers and organizations with limited resources. To address this, ALBERT, or A Lite BERT, offers a more resource-friendly alternative that retains BERT's strengths while significantly reducing the computational demands for training and deployment. In this study, we explore the application of ALBERT for abstractive text summarization in Indonesian, demonstrating its efficiency and effectiveness. Our fine-tuned ALBERT model, with optimized hyperparameters, achieves impressive ROUGE scores—comparable to those of BERT—despite requiring much less training time. This makes ALBERT a practical and economical choice for real-world applications, especially when computational resources are a concern. Through qualitative analysis, we found that ALBERT consistently generated summaries that were accurate, informative, and fluid, effectively capturing the main ideas of the original text, although occasionally shorter than reference summaries. The significant computational efficiency of ALBERT, which can be fine-tuned in about 50 minutes compared to the several hours required for models like BERT or BART, underscores its potential as a viable solution for text summarization tasks, offering a balance between performance and resource efficiency.",

It includes sensory substances, cognitive processes, behavioral influences, physiological responses, and communication. Therefore, emotion recognition is crucial in applications such as marketing, safe driving, human-computer interaction, healthcare, mental health monitoring, and safety. Emotional research for healthcare includes a large number of neurological disorders such as sleep disorders, schizophrenia, sleep quality assessment, and Parkinson’s disease. Studies have shown that emotions can have a great impact on human health, and bad emotions can act on people’s mental activities and cause mental illness, and even cause lesions of our tissues and organs through some complex physiological changes. Emotion is a comprehensive state of people’s feelings, thoughts, and behaviors. It plays a very important role in human life, affecting both people’s physiological and psychological states. Positive emotions help improve human health and productivity, while negative emotions can lead to health problems. Generally speaking, the data used for emotion recognition can be divided into two categories. The first category is the use of behavioral data such as facial expression and voice tone, which is simple to collect but easy to be masked or camouflaged. The second category is the use of physiological data such as electroencephalography (EEG), skin temperature (SKT), electro-oculogram (EOG), plethysmograph (PPG), respiration (RSP), electromyography (EMG), electrocardiogram (ECG) and Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) to identify emotions. Such data collection cannot be disguised and can obtain real and objective results. Among the above eight signals, electrocardiogram (ECG) and electrodermal response (GSR) generated signals can be collected at the wrist, while physiological signals need to be detected by special measuring instruments, and the analysis of physiological signals can identify internal emotions. Moreover, the sensor can be placed on the human body in a non-invasive and comfortable way to maintain good contact with the body, making the study of the emotional characteristics of physiological signals more appropriate to the reality. Therefore, it is significant to study emotion recognition based on physiological signals. In this context, it is proposed to use the wristband to collect physiological signals to identify people’s emotions, so that people can understand their emotional health in time. According to the recognition rate of skin electrical signals under SVM model is higher than that of heart rate signals, and the recognition accuracy of heart rate signals and skin electrical signals is not high compared with neutral emotions. The results of this experiment prove that it is feasible to use video to induce emotions, hoping to provide a new way of thinking for people who want to do experiments related to emotion recognition",

This potential largely stems from quantum circuits' inherent capability to encode and manipulate large amounts of information simultaneously. Although QML is still in its nascent stages with its theoretical quantum advantage under ongoing investigation and debate, there is a rising interest from sectors like industry, academia, and notable research organizations. The potential applications of QML extend beyond merely speeding up processes compared to classical methods; for instance, QML may excel at recognizing patterns or correlations that classical systems might overlook. Most early QML efforts have utilized emerging quantum computing technologies, such as superconducting or trapped-ion systems.

It is marked by persistent sadness or a lack of interest in daily activities, alongside symptoms such as low energy, weight changes, sleep disturbances, diminished self-worth, and concentration difficulties. These symptoms significantly disrupt social, occupational, and other important areas of life. Depression affects over 265 million people globally, making it one of the most burdensome diseases according to the World Health Organization. While it can occur at any age, depression is more common in early adulthood and is more prevalent in females than in males. The variation in depression rates across different regions can be attributed to genetic, biochemical, environmental, and psychosocial factors. Traditionally, depression is diagnosed based on patient-reported symptoms and clinical assessments through interviews and psychological evaluations. However, these methods have limitations like the absence of objective indicators and can miss symptoms or only reflect patient conditions at specific times. This study explores the use of machine learning to improve depression diagnosis, utilizing algorithms to analyze various data sources for early detection and accurate diagnosis.
