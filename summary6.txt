This study addresses the growing threat of credit card fraud (CCF), a type of identity theft in which someone other than the owner makes an unlawful transaction using a credit card or account details. In 2020, there were 393,207 cases of CCF out of approximately 1.4 million total identity theft, making it the second most prevalent form of fraud after government documents and benefits fraud. Payment card theft cost the global economy $24.26 billion last year, with the U.S. accounting for 38.6% of reported card fraud losses. The study explores the application of machine learning (ML) to identify CCF in the banking industry, focusing on supervised and unsupervised learning.
