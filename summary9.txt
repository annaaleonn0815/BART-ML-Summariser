This study focuses on the development of intrusion detection systems for network security. The rise of the internet has increased the amount and complexity of data, resulting in the emergence of big data. Machine learning (ML) algorithms are designed to generate output based on what is learned from data and examples. Deep learning (DL) is a new subfield of machine learning, which is itself a sub field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) DL is used to learn representations with many abstraction levels and mimic the human brain. The study explores the concept of an intrusion detection system, types of attacks, and how to train and train datasets.
