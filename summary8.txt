This study focuses on the development of explainable machine learning (XAI) systems that provide reasoning for ML model outputs, allowing humans to understand and trust ML models' decision-making process. Currently, XAI has become a trendy research topic, but the majority of the work has been focused on supervised machine learning methods. The study argues that real-world settings such as Cyber-Physical Domain (CPS) bring the challenge of dealing with large amounts of unlabelled data, making supervised ML alone not sufficient for making decision-driven decisions. The authors propose a novel Explainable Unsupervised Machine Learning (XUnML) approach using the Self Organizing Map (SOM) algorithm, a widely used unsupervised
