Machine Learning (ML) can be defined as a division of artificial intelligence based on the concept that machines can gain knowledge from data on their own and recognize pre-defined patterns. This enables machines to make decisions with minimal human involvement, essentially learning from experience. With advancements in scientific development and technical AI systems, machines are now able to learn and improve from new data without needing specific assistance code. Machine learning is increasingly significant due to its impactful role in decision making. Its primary focus is on applying various methods to find and extract hidden patterns from large databases. Machine learning and data mining algorithms are employed in diverse fields such as cluster analysis, the telecommunication industry, web search, tourism, financial forecasting, spam filtering, networking, travel, credit scoring, fraud detection, computer design, and electric load forecasting, among others. There are three main categories of machine learning. Within this paper, machine learning methods and algorithms, along with their implementations, are discussed. The paper also explores algorithms that explain different types of machine learning techniques, examines various machine learning applications, and reviews numerous processing tools. Additionally, it includes a study of various machine learning algorithms used in different fields, combining them with conventional approaches applied in recent years, and analyzes the limitations of previous models in the literature review section.
