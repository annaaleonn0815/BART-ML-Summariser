Allan et al. in his research paper Computing Machinery and Intelligence asked an important question whether the machine thinks can it may be replaced with whether machines do what we can do. This proposal leads to notable definition of machine learning. Without programmed explicitly, machine learning is the area of study that helps the computer to learn automatically. Machine learning is developed from the area of pattern recognition and artificial intelligence notably, machine learning it is the subfield of computer science. Machine learning is associated with computational statistics and specialized in prediction making. The current research on machine learning focuses on natural language processing, computer vision, pattern recognition, cognitive computing and knowledge representation. Machine learning methods may be referred as predictive modeling when employed in industrial contexts. The reminder of the literature is as follows: Section II, it introduces the machine learning approaches. Section III, concentrates on the supervised learning and its approaches, Section IV, depicts unsupervised learning and its techniques, Section V, focuses on semi-supervised learning and its concepts, Section VI, reviews reinforcement learning and its methods and we conclude with Section VII. In this study, various machine learning techniques and its approaches were analyzed. The classification of machine learning approaches such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning and reinforcement learning and its various algorithms are the important contributions of this study. In future we intend to develop a model based on machine learning techniques.
