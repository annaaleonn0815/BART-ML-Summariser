Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder that affects how the body converts food into energy, potentially impacting the entire body system. In the United States, a significant portion of adults with diabetes remain undiagnosed, which can lead to serious health complications such as heart disease, kidney disease, gum disease, vision loss, and nerve or blood vessel damage. Early detection is crucial for avoiding these severe health issues. Diabetes can be predicted based on various patient information features, such as age, blood pressure levels, smoking or drinking history, physical activity levels, and number of pregnancies. While hospitals and healthcare companies collect extensive amounts of this data, analyzing it manually is challenging and time-consuming. Artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning (ML) techniques, is increasingly used in healthcare to analyze medical data for disease diagnosis. Machine learning models can process large volumes of patient data quickly, learning patterns that indicate whether an individual has diabetes. These models can then apply this knowledge to new data to predict diabetes risk based on individual patient features. This study proposes using machine learning algorithms to predict diabetes diagnoses through classification models. Six machine learning models—Gaussian Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor, Linear Support Vector Clustering (SVC), and Ridge Classifier—are employed on two datasets: the ‘Pima Indians Diabetes’ dataset and the ‘Diabetes 2019’ dataset. The ‘Pima Indians Diabetes’ dataset includes features from female patients of Pima Indian heritage over the age of 21, while the ‘Diabetes 2019’ dataset includes a broader range of patient demographics. The Ridge Classifier achieved the highest accuracy of 83.12% with the Pima dataset, and both the Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers reached an accuracy of 95% with the Diabetes 2019 dataset. The goal is to identify the most effective algorithm for medical use in healthcare settings to improve early diabetes prediction and detection. This will assist healthcare workers in initiating treatment sooner, giving patients a better chance of avoiding severe complications. Similar research has shown high performance with various algorithms, but differences in pre-processing and feature selection make direct comparisons challenging. Future work could involve using additional algorithms and validation methods to enhance diabetes prediction accuracy. One of the limitations of our study is the difficulty in comparing results from our two datasets. As shown in Table 1 and Table 2, the evaluation metrics for all models, except for Linear SVC, were much higher with the “Diabetes 2019” dataset compared to the “Pima Indians Diabetes” dataset. This discrepancy arises because the “Pima Indians Diabetes” dataset includes data from a very specific demographic group—only females of Pima Indian heritage aged 21 or older—while the “Diabetes 2019” dataset covers a more generalized population without demographic restrictions. This limitation suggests that the ML models might perform better with more generalized data that has a greater number of features. Specifically, the “Pima Indians Diabetes” dataset has only 8 features, whereas the “Diabetes 2019” dataset includes 17 features. Our primary goal was to evaluate the reliability of various machine learning models to identify the most effective algorithms for real healthcare systems. The best models for predicting diabetes in our experiments were Ridge Classification, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. We achieved the highest accuracy scores of 83.12% with the Ridge Classifier for the “Pima Indians Diabetes” dataset and 95% with both Random Forest and Decision Tree Classifiers for the “Diabetes 2019” dataset. These accuracy scores suggest strong performance, as an accuracy score above 80% generally indicates high model effectiveness. Additionally, the top algorithms—Ridge Classifier, Random Forest, and Decision Tree—also showed high precision scores, meaning they were effective at correctly identifying patients who have diabetes among those predicted to have it. They also demonstrated high recall scores, indicating a strong True Positive Rate and effective identification of patients with diabetes among those who actually have it. Given these results, we recommend these three ML models—Ridge Classifier, Random Forest, and Decision Tree—for diabetes prediction in healthcare settings. Their high evaluation metric values suggest they can accurately predict diabetes diagnoses from patient data, which could help healthcare providers initiate proper treatment sooner and reduce the risk of complications associated with undiagnosed diabetes cases.
