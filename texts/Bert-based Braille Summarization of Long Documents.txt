In today’s world, time is a valuable investment, and in our busy lives, most of us hardly have time to read a complete book, let alone spend time finding one that interests us. Books are packed with insights into knowledge and life, blurring the boundaries of age restrictions and encouraging us in the hardest of times. The first rule of choosing books is to read what you like! With so many options, any reader can find a book that suits their preferences. Usually, a reader picks a book of their preferred genre by reading the inside flap. If the plot description seems interesting, then that’s the book. The situation is not the same for people who are visually impaired or have lost their ability to see; they have to read braille with their fingertips or use special equipment, which complicates the process a bit more. Braille is a unique system of reading and writing developed for the visually impaired, with a set of symbols composed of small rectangular braille cells containing tiny three-dimensional tactile bumps called raised dots, traditionally written with embossed paper as thick as a file folder or index card. Technological advancements have made it possible for all of us to walk together regardless of the disabilities people face; for example, braille e-readers highly stress improving cognitive skills and boosting literacy and numeracy in the visually impaired community. Speech synthesizers are also commonly used for this task, but the method of reading through braille remains popular in the daily lives of visually impaired people, especially the deaf-blind. Despite a steadily increasing number of books becoming available electronically as soft copies, the number of books in braille available for specially-abled people is relatively low, necessitating the translation of available English books into braille. This translation must occur before the visually challenged community can read the books with their fingertips or electronic equipment. However, manual translation and summarization are time-consuming and prone to errors, highlighting the need for advanced language processing techniques capable of handling larger documents such as books. Document summarization is a useful means for quickly browsing and finding books of interest. Single-document summarization involves automatically creating a shorter version of a document and has garnered significant interest in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) community due to its potential applications for information access. Existing summarization systems focus primarily on content quality and fluency, typically extracting informative and diverse sentences from the input text to form a summary of a specific length or constructing an abstractive summary by rewording and rebuilding sentences. Despite being highly desirable for various reasons and the focus of numerous research papers, abstractive summarization is challenging to generate automatically, often requiring extensive Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) for training via deep learning approaches or complex algorithms and rules with limited applicability in conventional NLP methods. Furthermore, it necessitates a more in-depth examination of domain-specific text. With this challenge in mind, this paper employs extractive summarization. Although many neural models have been proposed for extractive summarization recently, a significant number utilize outdated NLP algorithms requiring regular maintenance due to poor generalization. Consequently, many summary outputs from these tools may appear irregular in their content creation. Attempts for end-to-end training of documents for summarization tasks have been made but have yet to achieve significant performance improvements. Additionally, summaries are typically produced for sighted people rather than the visually impaired. A text summary can be translated into a braille summary, where the length of the braille summary is defined by the number of braille cells. Automatic translation is crucial here, as manual translation is tedious and time-consuming. This work addresses the difficulty of summarizing long documents in braille. Although substantial research exists in text summarization, most has focused on short documents such as news articles, with minimal research on long documents like books. Books vary in length and genre, necessitating diverse summarization methods. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark by compiling a dataset of books with human-generated summaries obtained online, designed specifically for generating braille summaries. To accommodate better encoding and attention at both the word and sentence levels, along with potential external memory units for storing significant information, we use the bert-extractive-summarizer, a variant of BERT, as an encoder for extractive summarization. We have also developed a novel English & Braille interconversion library to generate braille summaries. We collected data for 20 books, with a mean length of 475,258 words and summaries averaging 7,476 words. The dataset includes books ranging from 108,049 to 893,246 words, with reference summaries spanning 2,837 to 15,236 words. For very long books, summaries tend to be longer. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) results provide a better understanding of the dataset used for braille summarization, with word clouds and Flesch Scores illustrating readability. Table I presents ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, and ROUGE-L figures for our summarizer compared to benchmark datasets, though the comparison is limited due to data type differences. While much work has been done in text summarization, most research focuses on short documents. This paper contributes by addressing gaps in long document summarization, irrespective of domain and genre, and avoiding secondary or redundant information. We believe this work makes significant progress by collecting large document book data for future research and setting a new benchmark for long document summarization using our novel English & Braille interconversion library. Our summarizer's ROUGE Measure demonstrates accuracy with relatively lower error rates against existing benchmarks. With books available in English and now in braille, we hope automation in braille book summarization will enable informed reading choices among the visually challenged. This work could extend to designing an end-to-end model for generating braille summarizations directly from braille books, enhancing research in both English and braille book summarization.
