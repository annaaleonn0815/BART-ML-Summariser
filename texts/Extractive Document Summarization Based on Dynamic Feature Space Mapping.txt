The expansion of the Internet and Web applications, coupled with the growing influence of smartphones on every aspect of our lives, has led to an explosion of textual information. This surge in data generation not only makes it challenging for humans to summarize but also overwhelms even advanced machines, which struggle to process this massive amount of generated data from various technologies, applications, and organizations. Analyzing large volumes of mostly unstructured data is quite challenging, if not impossible. This explosion of documents necessitates automated document summarization, which aims to create shorter versions of documents while preserving their essential information. Summarization techniques have become crucial for decision-making and gaining insights from data. For instance, social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook are utilized for both personal and professional purposes, including marketing and political campaigns. These platforms have become central to global political campaigns, making the extraction of relevant textual information vital for successful strategies. Automatic text summarization is not limited to marketing or political campaigns; it is also used for compressed descriptions in search engine results and keyword-directed news subscriptions. Effective summarization of social media content can enhance user experience by improving navigation and maintaining user trust. Despite its long history, text summarization remains a critical research area due to its practical applications. Initially, text summarization referred to extracting the most informative parts to create a compressed version of a document for a specific user or task. More recently, it has been defined as a text produced from one or more documents that conveys the important information in the original text, usually significantly less than that. This definition emphasizes that summaries should be derived from one or more documents, retain essential information, and reduce the original text by at least 50%. Document summarization models are primarily categorized into extractive and abstractive methods. Abstractive approaches aim to deeply understand the text and then generate a shorter version, while extractive methods focus on selecting the most informative units from the original text. Due to the complexity of generating human-like summaries, extractive approaches are more commonly used in practice. Extractive summarization methods can be further classified into unsupervised and supervised approaches. Unsupervised methods seek to identify representative sentences, while supervised methods frame summarization as a binary classification task, where sentences are classified as either included in the summary or not. This article introduces ExDoS, a novel intelligent summarization approach that integrates both supervised and unsupervised algorithms in an interpretable manner. ExDoS features several innovative aspects: it combines clustering and classification into a single objective function, where clustering uncovers the underlying data structure and enhances the classification stage, thus improving summarization performance. Features are dynamically weighted through the optimization process within each cluster, indicating the role of each feature in distinguishing between classes. ExDoS selects sentences to ensure that summaries are coherent and non-redundant, with crucial information presented prominently and additional sentences chosen to cover all key points without redundancy. The approach eliminates the need for extensive feature engineering, which is often a critical phase in machine learning algorithms. While prior work has focused on sentence selection, ExDoS improves summarization by optimizing feature relevance dynamically. Empirical results demonstrate that ExDoS efficiently captures essential feature patterns. Sentences are modeled as vectors of features, and the final output groups similar sentences with locally weighted features in each group, reflecting their importance in different clusters. Main contributions include introducing a combined supervised and unsupervised approach that formalizes a novel method integrating clustering and classification for document summarization, measuring feature importance for each class individually through various feature spaces, achieving state-of-the-art performance across different datasets, and performing human evaluation to show that ExDoS produces less redundant and more informative summaries than competing approaches. Additionally, ExDoS offers interpretability by clearly separating terms in the optimization process, making it easier to understand and explain system decisions to end-users. This article also proposes a general-purpose extractive approach for summarizing documents, achieving better results than most state-of-the-art methods in efficiency and performance. The post-trained weights represent the importance of each feature in discriminating each class. Future work will focus on using crowd knowledge to update weights, incorporating user preferences to improve summaries implicitly.
