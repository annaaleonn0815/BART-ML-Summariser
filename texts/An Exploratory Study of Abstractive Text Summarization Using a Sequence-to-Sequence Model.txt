Automatic text summarization aims to generate shortened versions from lengthy documents, a task that is difficult and costly to undertake manually. Text summarization is particularly useful when the volume of content is large. There are two primary approaches to text summarization: abstractive summarization and extractive summarization. Extractive summarization is simpler compared to abstractive summarization as it involves taking sentences directly from the original document. In contrast, abstractive summarization is more complex and generates novel sentences by rewriting and reformulating the text. This approach mimics human summarization by focusing on critical information from the original text and generating new text. It involves extracting key information, understanding the context, and constructing new sentences, which makes it more complex than extractive summarization due to the need to both extract relevant information and create new text. Abstractive summarization works well with deep learning models. Word and phrase frequency methods can also be utilized for automatic summarization. Various techniques such as the cue method, title method, and location method are used to calculate sentence weight. Extractive summarization can be performed using intermediate representation, sentiment score, and sentence selection. Approaches to topic representation include topic words, frequency-based methods, word probability, TFIDF, centroid-based summarization, LSA, and Bayesian topic models. Different forms of content summarization include web summarization, scientific article summarization, and email summarization. Methods for text summarization include the graph method and machine learning. Over time, text summarization has evolved across various domains, benefiting professionals and researchers alike. To provide efficient summarization quickly, various approaches have been developed. The goal of this article is to apply the sequence-to-sequence model to generate concise and precise summaries. The sequence-to-sequence model, used in several NLP applications, offers better results compared to traditional methods. Future work could involve implementing stacked GRUs instead of LSTM networks and assessing performance by incorporating attention layers that focus on specific parts of the input text.
