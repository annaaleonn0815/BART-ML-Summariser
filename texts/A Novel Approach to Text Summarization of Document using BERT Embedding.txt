Because of the growth of social media, online education services, and all professional fields, the amount of knowledge accessible over the internet has expanded in recent years. The main format in which this information is growing is textual data. As a result, the key problem now is processing and understanding such a large volume of data. Condensing the textual content, also known as summarising [2], which is the act of minimising the amount of textual data, is the only option to address this problem. Condensing information into brief summaries is challenging, though. It necessitates having in-depth understanding of the content being summarised. This problem can be resolved using one NLP technique, text summarization, which is discussed further in this section [1]. The overview of the current methodologies is the primary topic of this study. Although several review articles for the text summarising of documents utilising BERT embedding systems have been published in the literature, we have critically examined and methodically described the most recent, significant, and important works. The potential remedy for text summarization systems is also provided in this research. This document's layout is as follows. Section 2 has a systematic presentation of the literature review, which includes a summary of the work experience in addition to key characteristics of the linked techniques. Section 3 sets the stage for the conceptualization of the issue and the discovered problem. Section 4 describes in detail how the selected strategy works. Section 5 reports the experimental findings, while Section 6 provides the perspective.",
