Various COVID-19 vaccines have been developed and tested worldwide since March 2020, when the pandemic was declared. It has been shown that public health measures can somewhat limit COVID-19 spread, but establishing and maintaining protective immunity through vaccinations is essential for ending the pandemic. To achieve some level of herd immunity, at least 70% of the population would need to be vaccinated. The public must support vaccination to achieve this. It is therefore vital to understand public attitudes towards vaccination and, therefore, what the public is willing to accept. [2] investigated public health perspectives through traditional surveys. However, social media is progressively being used to discuss and share experiences on outbreaks of infectious diseases and health topics. Several pandemic-related topics, including vaccines, have been discussed using social media as a forum during the current COVID-19 pandemic. In [5], it is observed that social media users may express their negative sentiments which leads to vaccine uncertainty or rejection. It is said by WHO that globally, vaccine hesitancy is the major health threat. Simple evocative analyses of vaccine-related tweets have been employed in prior studies to evaluate public sentiment on immunization. Figure 1 depicts the various approaches of sentiment analysis. To extract sentiments from clean tweets, the TextBlob library is used. Figure-3 shows the count of neutral, positive, and negative tweets. There are 78,771 positive tweets, 23,993 tweets found negative, and almost 125,443 tweets are neutral. Figure-4 shows the most common positive words. Figure-6 and Figure-6 represent the most common negative and neutral words in tweets respectively. Table 1 represents the precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy of BMB, SVM, and LR models. The SVM model gives the highest accuracy of 97%. The accuracy of the BMB model and LR model are 81% and 95% respectively.
