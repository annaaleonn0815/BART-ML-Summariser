Machine learning is viewed as one of the most progressive and researched areas in recent years. With such a broad application area, it is only natural that the business would want to benefit from it. Research on the topic of machine learning is quite a lot and this paper aims to give an overview of some of it. The publication is structured as follows: Section II gives a definition to the term "business process"; Section III outlines some of the challenges when building and implementing a machine learning model for business purposes. Section IV gives some guides when choosing an algorithm for machine learning. Finally, some conclusions are presented. From the overview of the implementation and usage of machine learning in business some conclusions can be drawn: more than one algorithm could be used in a business organization as usually different problems require different solutions, ex. different algorithms. Every machine learning algorithm that is chosen must meet certain criteria, such as being able to handle small sets of data; having small computation resources; missing or incorrect data should not render too much influence on the accuracy of the model; the algorithms used for business must be easily understandable.
