Since agriculture provides a livelihood for a sizable portion of India's population, it is essential to the nation's economic development. Nonetheless, the agricultural industry confronts complex difficulties, as farmers struggle to choose which crops are best to grow in a particular situation. Complications stem from a variety of soil properties, fluctuating weather patterns, common plant illnesses, and the continuous requirement for crop observation. This research suggests a thorough and cutting-edge strategy to assist agricultural decision-making in order to address these issues. Our suggested method utilizes a wide variety of sophisticated machine learning models, such as XGBoost, Decision Tree approaches, Random Forest model, and Support Vector Classification (SVC) based on accuracy values. Our goal is to find the best model for accurate crop detection through thorough analysis and comparison. The main objective is to increase the precision and effectiveness of selecting the best crops to grow, providing farmers with tools for data-driven decision-making. We leverage the strength of the deep learning model ResNet, a deep learning architecture renowned for its speed and accuracy, in the field of plant disease detection. Our goal in implementing this model is to quickly and accurately diagnose plant diseases. By enabling prompt disease detection, this technology gives farmers the ability to prevent and manage disease outbreaks, ultimately protecting their crops. In the future, we see Internet of Things (IoT) technology being integrated, using Bolt IoT in conjunction with an LDR sensor to determine the plant's light intensity. This real-time light condition monitoring helps to improve the accuracy of crop recommendations. In addition, we use the ESP32 platform in conjunction with an NPK sensor to ascertain the soil's values for nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). This novel method enables accurate evaluation of the soil's health and customized fertilizer recommendations based on the soil's unique nutrient needs. In conclusion, this all-encompassing strategy leverages deep learning capabilities, integrates IoT technology, and combines advanced machine learning techniques to transform agricultural practices. Our mission is to advance India's agricultural sector, give farmers invaluable insights, and promote efficient and sustainable farming practices through innovative and technologically advanced solutions. Crop disease detection and recommendation systems play critical roles in providing farmers with accurate decision-making tools. The addition of a fertilizer suggestion system improves this capability by providing information on soil nutrient levels, which aids in crop selection. Furthermore, the integration of IoT sensors, including NPK sensors, provides continuous real-time data monitoring, thus reducing the need for costly laboratory assessments. The integration of an LDR sensor enables specialized crop care solutions, allowing farmers to effectively meet individual growth requirements. Together, these components comprise a comprehensive and efficient agriculture management system, allowing farmers to make intelligent choices and maximize crop production in a sustainable manner.
