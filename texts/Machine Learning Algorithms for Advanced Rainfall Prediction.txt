Rainfall, a fundamental component of the Earth’s hydrological cycle, plays a pivotal role in shaping our environment and sustaining life. Accurate rainfall prediction has substantial consequences for a variety of industries, including water resource management, agriculture, disaster planning, and climate research. Accurate rainfall forecast is critical for informed decision-making and sustainable development in many areas of our life, from agriculture to disaster management. Over the years, traditional methods for rainfall prediction have shown limitations in providing precise and timely forecasts. However, the advent of machine learning (ML) has opened up new avenues for improving rainfall prediction [11-20]. The purpose of this review article is to offer a complete overview of current breakthroughs in the use of machine learning algorithms for rainfall prediction. Machine learning offers the promise of harnessing the power of data-driven algorithms to enhance the accuracy, lead time, and spatial resolution of rainfall forecasts. These advancements have the potential to revolutionize our ability to anticipate and mitigate the impacts of rainfall-related events such as floods, droughts, and landslides. In this paper, we will delve into the key challenges associated with rainfall prediction, such as the complex and nonlinear nature of precipitation processes, data sparsity, and the need for real-time forecasting. We will explore various machine learning models, data sources, and pre-processing techniques that have been employed to tackle these challenges. Additionally, we will discuss the integration of satellite data, weather radar information, and climate models into machine learning-based rainfall prediction systems. Furthermore, the review will encompass a critical analysis of the performance of these ML models in different geographic regions and climatic conditions, while also considering their limitations and potential for future enhancements. By evaluating the current state of the art in rainfall prediction using machine learning, this paper aims to guide researchers, meteorologists, and policymakers in harnessing the full potential of ML for more accurate and reliable rainfall forecasts, ultimately contributing to the better management of our precious water resources and the mitigation of rainfall-related disasters. In this work, we examine several studies and critique their systems and procedures by presenting a comparative study of those studies. The review paper is organized as follows: Section 2 includes a review of the previous research and studies on this topic. Section 3 contains a brief review of the machine learning algorithms that were used in earlier investigations. Section 4 gives a comparison of the studies. Section 5 describes the work’s conclusion. Predicting natural phenomena such as rainfall is a tough challenge that is still being researched. We have looked at several machine learning algorithms, data sources, and feature engineering strategies for rainfall prediction throughout this research. These methods have proven their capacity to detect complicated patterns in meteorological data, resulting in more accurate and trustworthy rainfall predictions. In addition, the review emphasized the significance of interpretability and explainability in machine learning models for rainfall prediction, particularly when these models are utilized in crucial decision-making processes. Rainfall prediction using machine learning is expected to evolve in the future, benefiting from advances in processing power, data availability, and algorithm development.
