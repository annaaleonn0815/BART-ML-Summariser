Machine learning (ML) is a discipline of computer science that designs algorithms for extracting useful information from data. It has been a thematic research area in the last two decades and has found applications in many industrial sectors and academic disciplines. ML algorithms have therefore been used in many fields, including reliability and maintenance (R&M), which this paper briefly reviews concerning its state-of-the-art development. The advance of data collection technologies has made it possible to monitor the conditions of physical systems, resulting in large volumes of reliability and maintenance-related data. ML algorithms have gradually been adapted for reliability analysis and maintenance policy optimization. In the literature, terms like data mining and artificial intelligence are often used interchangeably with machine learning, covering similar research areas. ML chiefly encompasses three subdisciplines: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning is based on observations of input-output pairs, aiming to learn a relationship or function between them, and can be categorized into regression modeling and classification modeling. Regression modeling applies when the output is a continuous variable, while classification modeling is used for discrete variables. Techniques like linear regression and logistic regression are typical examples, though some ML algorithms can be used for both regression and classification tasks, such as support vector methods and decision trees. Unsupervised learning is used when the output is unknown, involving tasks like cluster analysis, while reinforcement learning focuses on learning actions in uncertain or complex environments to maximize rewards. The application of ML in R&M is primarily in reliability assessment, condition monitoring, fault diagnosis, and data-driven maintenance policy scheduling. R&M data typically come from maintenance logs, condition monitoring, and warranty claims. Several research topics in ML for R&M are noteworthy. One challenge is the lack of failure data, which is essential for developing reliable R&M algorithms. Novelty detection and Bayesian machine learning techniques may address this issue by integrating reliability data with other information, including expert opinions. Additionally, the interpretability of ML algorithms, such as neural networks, can be limited, as models with many variables may be difficult for practitioners to manage. There is also a need for algorithms specifically tailored to the unique traits of reliability data, such as incomplete or censored failure data, as most existing ML algorithms applied to R&M analysis are general rather than specifically designed for R&M tasks. Developing ML algorithms that cater specifically to R&M could advance the field significantly.
