The Global Positioning System (GPS), based on a satellite radio navigation system, provides extremely accurate outdoor positioning but does not penetrate solid structures and is not applicable indoors. To address indoor positioning challenges, wireless sensor networks, which include sensors like infrared and Bluetooth, were developed. Methods in this category include Time of Arrival (TOA), Angle of Arrival (AOA), and Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA). However, due to the high cost associated with sensor-related hardware, these methods have not gained widespread popularity. In contrast, integrated Wi-Fi cards in consumer mobile phones offer a cost-efficient solution by leveraging the positioning capability of wireless local area networks (WLAN). Fingerprinting based on Received Signal Strength (RSS) is one of the most popular methods within WLAN positioning. RSS fingerprinting involves gathering information on a radio transmission and identifying the transmitting device. Recently, fingerprint positioning methods have received extensive attention from scholars and researchers, becoming an important technology for solving complex environment positioning problems. With the advancement of wearable devices and the Internet of Things era, fingerprint positioning methods are expected to have great potential and become a hot research area. However, existing fingerprint positioning technology is still developing, and many challenges remain. Therefore, it is crucial to address these issues by improving algorithms and strategies. Machine learning methods have been incorporated into the four-step development process of indoor localization methods to enhance existing solutions. In the offline stage, semi-supervised and transfer learning can significantly reduce the effort and cost of building a fingerprinting database. Self-adapting algorithms automatically update the database and allow for scalability. Feature extraction algorithms transform the original fingerprinting data into feature sets with less noise. Mapping functions created by machine learning between fingerprints and locations require fewer reference points and improve localization accuracy. Finally, clustering techniques enhance localization efficiency by using a 'divide-and-conquer' approach in cases with very large datasets. Research results on machine learning models depend on factors such as environment setup, database quality, de-noise techniques, and prediction models. Methods using simple averages of nearest neighbors have poor accuracy. Liu proposed a novel localization method combining genetic algorithms (GA) and neural networks (NN) in a simulated environment. The GA optimizes predictions on access points, achieving 42% outperformance compared to benchmark error averages. The neural network then models the nonlinear relationship between location and GA-optimized fingerprints, showing a 72.95% probability of achieving localization errors lower than 0.5 meters. However, accuracy improvement is minimal when the signal-to-noise ratio increases to 10 dB. Ibrahim et al. suggest using a time-series of RSS readings to de-noise measurements and applying a convolutional neural network (CNN) to account for temporal information in RSS fingerprints. Using the UJIIndoorLoc dataset, which covers three buildings with multiple floors, the authors achieved 99.9% accuracy for floor prediction using averaged RSS vectors and 100% accuracy with concatenated and image-like RSS time-series. This is higher than the DNN approach by Kim, which achieved a 91.27% floor hit rate. Temporal features in time-series data contain rich information, and complex network structures can explore such nonlinear relationships, improving localization accuracy. Polak compared the performance of several machine learning methods, including KNN, random forest, and neural networks, in a multi-channel and multi-anchor environment setup. The best model, a Random Forest classifier, achieved an accuracy of over 99% in a concrete building with various obstacles. All machine learning models achieved accuracy over 95% on the test set. Salamah et al. conducted indoor experiments on machine learning classifiers, including KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines, in both static and dynamic modes. They applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to address duplication issues with RSS reception and reduce computational burden. Random Forest in static mode achieved a 70% reduction in computation time, while KNN in dynamic mode achieved a 33% reduction. Overall, research indicates that machine learning methods, whether classifiers or regressors, deliver high accuracy in indoor localization. The choice of specific models depends on dataset properties such as the number of access points, channels, and time-series characteristics. Techniques like GA, convolutional functions, and PCA can be applied before neural network models to address duplication and noise issues, further improving accuracy. Consequently, calibration costs for establishing databases in target areas can be reduced. Further research in this area is beneficial and potentially profitable for industrialization.
