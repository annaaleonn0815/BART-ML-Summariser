Since the emergence of computers, the reliance of individuals and companies on them has increased at a remarkable pace. With the advent of the Internet, this dependence became even more pronounced. The amount of data and information stored on disks began to surge, making information extraction from such vast amounts of data a tedious task often associated with information overload. To access information quickly, it is crucial to represent it in a more compact format. Automatic Text Summarization (ATS) is one solution to this need, and it has been a part of text summarization research for over five decades. Text summarization aims to extract information in a way that preserves valuable content while avoiding redundancy from the original format. By eliminating redundant data from digital documents, text summarization has been utilized to aid people with various medical disabilities, such as individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Techniques used for multi-document summarization have also benefited researchers working with languages other than English; for instance, Oufaida et al. applied the Minimum Redundancy and Maximum Coverage algorithm (mRMC) for Arabic text. Text summarization falls into two broad categories: single-document summarization and multi-document summarization. Single-document summarization extracts significant information from a single document to present it concisely, while multi-document summarization deals with aggregating information from multiple sources, providing a summary that represents the essence of the information across several documents. Multi-document summarization is more complex due to the diversity of themes within a large set of documents. Summarization can be either Abstractive or Extractive. Abstractive summaries involve rephrasing the content with a deep understanding of the text, utilizing semantic representation and natural language generation techniques. In contrast, Extractive summaries consist of selecting and combining important text units from the source documents verbatim. Extractive methods can be further categorized into query-based or generic, and supervised or unsupervised techniques. Generic summarization focuses on the main topic of documents, while query-based summarization generates summaries based on specific user queries. To provide a comprehensive overview of research in this field, a systematic survey of extractive techniques for multi-document summarization (MDS) was conducted. The survey serves as a foundation for identifying research gaps. The paper is organized into sections covering a detailed literature review, datasets used, evaluation techniques, discussion, and conclusions. State-of-the-art techniques in extractive MDS are discussed, including ontology-based methods, term-based methods (such as clustering, latent-semantic, and non-negative matrix factorization methods), rhetoric structure theory-based methods, and graph-based methods. The survey proposes guidelines for new researchers, emphasizing these techniques and critically analyzes various studies, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. It also identifies open issues for further research: diversity in summarization, minimizing redundancy, improving informativeness, and ensuring grammaticality. Additionally, the absence of summarization tools for languages like Urdu presents a potential area for future NLP research.
