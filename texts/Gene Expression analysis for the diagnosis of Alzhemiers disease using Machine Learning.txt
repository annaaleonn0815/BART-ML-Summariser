Between 40 to 50 million people worldwide suffer from dementia at present time; between 1990 and 2016, this number more than doubled. As individuals grow older, it is expected that Alzheimer's Disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, will become more prevalent. The number of instances increases in lockstep with the expenditures. In 2010, the estimated global cost of Alzheimer's disease was $604 billion. It is projected that between 2030 and 2050, the illness's related healthcare costs will surpass $2 trillion globally. More than 131 million people are expected to be affected by the year 2050. As a result, AD is quickly gaining prominence as a serious global scale and economic problem. It is necessary to identify and quantify the underlying genetic risk factors and regulatory markers, particularly through early detection of pre-symptomatic cases. Intensive scientific research is being carried out to reduce the health burden caused by this disease. A meticulous genetic selection (GS) algorithm forms the core of the framework, identifying eight gene subsets from the original set. The algorithm selects the most suitable subset and machine learning (ML) model for AD prediction. In general, machine learning approaches can significantly increase the accuracy and efficiency of gene expression analysis, a crucial diagnostic tool for complex illnesses like AD. The progressive loss of memory and cognitive abilities is the hallmark of AD, a neurodegenerative disease for which early discovery is essential to developing successful treatment plans. Bioinformatics analysis has been employed to comprehensively integrate data and unveil novel genes linked to diverse diseases, potentially serving as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. It is possible to find useful gene cells that can accurately distinguish AD patients from healthy individuals by using machine learning techniques to examine gene cell data. Neurodegenerative disease clinical diagnosis is chronically imprecise, and available techniques are frequently costly, time-consuming, or intrusive. When paired with the results of cognitive assessments, straightforward, low-cost, and non-invasive diagnostic techniques may offer significant assistance to medical professionals. Biological processes leading to neuropathology can affect both the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral vascular system (PVS), potentially remaining asymptomatic for years. Large-scale gene cell databases are the end result of this, and they go through data preparation stages to eliminate noise and adjust for technological differences. Machine learning techniques can be used to find patterns and connections between gene cell profiles and disease status after the data has been cleansed. Many machine learning algorithms are used in AD diagnosis, including classification and logistic regression models. In classification tasks, supervised learning methods like Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are frequently used to categorize individuals as either AD patients or healthy controls based on gene expression in each cell data. Following that, the ability to differentiate was evaluated by measuring the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC). Ultimately, the inflammatory status of AD was evaluated through the utilization of the CIBERSORT algorithm and analysis of immune cell infiltration. These cells typically comprise a selection of genes that act in relation to the underlying molecular mechanisms of AD and are expressed differently in patients compared to controls. Furthermore, important genes or biomarkers that are crucial to the diagnosis of AD can be found using machine learning algorithms, which offers important new information about the molecular processes underlying the pathophysiology of AD. Gene expression analysis for Alzheimer's diagnosis faces challenges due to variable gene expression, lack of specificity, and limited predictive ability, compounded by sample heterogeneity and practical constraints. In conclusion, combining machine learning methods with gene expression in each cell data, researchers may efficiently evaluate large-scale gene expression datasets, find informative gene cells, and create precise diagnostic models by utilizing the capabilities of machine learning algorithms. This strategy will definitely become more accurate and useful as machine learning algorithms and gene expression technologies progress, making it a vital weapon in the fight against Alzheimer's disease. By careful analysis of machine learning models included as SVM, Decision Trees (DT), Random Forest Classifiers (RFC), and Logistic Regression (LR), the analysis made by taking average combinations of all the gene expressions together and determining the most suitable model as SVM with an accuracy of 85%. Other performance metrics include that this model compares to be the least error measure. Hence, the value of accurate prediction will be higher. In future processes, the AD prediction can be profoundly accurate using high-level deep learning algorithms with well-tuned data.
