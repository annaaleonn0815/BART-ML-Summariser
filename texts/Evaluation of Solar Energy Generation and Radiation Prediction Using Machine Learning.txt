In India, energy demand is increasing day by day. The current energy generation relies heavily on fossil fuels, which account for about 70% of energy production in India. Fossil fuels are finite resources and produce harmful gases, which increase health risks and contribute to climate change. Therefore, there is a need for alternative energy sources, such as renewable energy sources (RES). The primary advantages of RES include their infinite supply, pollution-free nature, easy availability, and cost-effectiveness. RES-based energy systems can meet electricity demand and reduce dependency on fossil fuels. However, a significant challenge with RES is that generation and weather conditions are unpredictable. Forecasting technologies are employed to enhance the efficiency of RES systems. Among RES, solar energy is the most prominent compared to wind, biomass, and ocean energy. Machine learning (ML) methods aid in predicting photovoltaic (PV) energy system generation and weather forecasting. In the field of computer science, known as machine learning, it is possible to train computers to act naturally by feeding them data. This means that information is processed by the computer system to extract insights without relying on pre-set models. ML algorithms identify patterns in data and then apply these patterns to new data. Forecasting energy production, solar radiation, wind speed, and other factors are facilitated by ML and its prediction algorithms. Numerous papers on the use of ML in PV energy systems have been published recently. This paper reviews recent advances in ML for PV energy systems and provides a state-of-the-art overview of current algorithms for academics and researchers. The main contributions of this paper are: identifying ML techniques for forecasting PV energy system generation, identifying ML techniques for forecasting solar radiation, and reviewing different types of ML methods. The literature review covers advanced methods for predicting solar radiation and PV energy system generation. Predicting PV generation has received significant research attention, with various ML-based models proposed in this area. Historical and real-time weather data are used to predict weather conditions using ML algorithms. ML methods such as artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), and regression are employed for forecasting PV energy production, with key parameters including RMSE, MAE, and R2. For forecasting solar radiation, ML methods like ANN, SVM, and feature selection are used, with main prediction parameters being RMSE, MAE, and MSE. The accuracy and reliability of predictions depend on historical data of PV energy generation output. Forecasting energy generation information allows system operators to manage energy flow and reduce operational costs. ML algorithms provide reliable and precise predictions for solar irradiance and PV generation at specific locations. Future work involves improving the efficiency of solar energy-based systems using deep learning methods to enhance performance, accuracy, and reliability. ML will also aid in controlling and developing smart infrastructure for solar PV energy systems. Additionally, ML has the potential to improve generation, transmission, distribution, and reduce transmission losses.
