In recent years, the healthcare sector has increasingly integrated machine learning (ML) into its processes. This includes applications in diagnostics, treatment recommendations, patient monitoring, and operational efficiency. ML's ability to analyze vast amounts of data and identify patterns without human intervention makes it a powerful tool in advancing healthcare. This paper reviews the various ways in which ML is applied in healthcare, including its benefits and limitations. The discussion includes the role of different types of ML algorithms—such as supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning—in processing medical data, predicting disease outcomes, and aiding in clinical decision-making.
