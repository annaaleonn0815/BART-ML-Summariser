With the rapid development of digitization and artificial intelligence, traditional industries are being impacted like never before and must adapt to these changes. Along with the massive amount of data being generated, there is an urgent problem that needs solving: extracting valuable insights and making informed decisions from such data. Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for data analysis and automatic decision-making. However, accurately predicting outcomes and understanding the underlying factors remains a serious and rewarding challenge due to the abundance of data and increasing complexity of real-world problems. The use of machine learning in sports has developed significantly over the last decade. Initially, basic statistical analysis and regression models were used to predict outcomes and analyze player performance. However, these models were not satisfactory in dealing with more complex data and situations. As computing power increased and large-scale sports datasets became available, machine learning techniques such as logistic regression (LR), support vector machines (SVM), random forests, and neural networks gained prominence. In the past five years, deep learning models, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), have become mainstream due to their advantages in handling complex nonlinear systems. Additionally, Natural Language Processing (NLP) has enhanced the analysis of textual data and improved model accuracy. With the commercialization of sports analytics, the ability to accurately predict game outcomes has become crucial for team tactical planning and fan engagement. Machine learning applications can provide a better understanding of the factors that lead to success in sports, helping to make more informed decisions and giving teams, coaches, and analysts a competitive advantage. The increased availability of sports data and advances in machine learning technology make it critical to apply these techniques for predicting sports game outcomes, optimizing strategies, and improving performance. In this study, we designed a series of experiments to collect and filter NBA game data to create suitable datasets for analysis using different models. The design steps are as follows: Data Collection: Gather NBA game data from reliable sources, including player statistics, team statistics, and game-specific details. Data Filtering: Remove irrelevant or redundant variables and focus on key factors affecting game outcomes. Model Comparison: Train and evaluate different machine learning models using the filtered dataset, and assess each model's performance with appropriate metrics. Identify Factors: Analyze the best-performing models to determine the factors that most significantly impact predictions. The experiment has several advantages, including using a comprehensive dataset that covers all aspects of NBA games, comparing different machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, random forests, support vector machines), and identifying key factors influencing game outcomes. This approach provides a more thorough understanding of the problem and offers actionable insights for decision-making. The article is organized as follows: Section 2 describes related works, Section 3 details the experimental method, Section 4 presents the experimental results and analyses, and Section 5 discusses conclusions and future work. Figure 5 shows the confusion matrix, which indicates the counts of true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN). TP represents correct predictions of the positive class (home team wins), TN represents correct predictions of the negative class (home team does not win), FP represents incorrect positive predictions, and FN represents incorrect negative predictions. Accuracy represents overall correctness of the modelâ€™s predictions, while precision is the ratio of true positives to all positives. Recall is the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives, and the F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. Figure 5 also shows the ROC curve, plotting the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) at different thresholds, with the area under the ROC curve (AUC) indicating the model's overall performance. In all cases, LR and RF significantly outperform SVM and LSTM, with RF performing best when values are close in recall calculations. Depending on the target, different parameters are chosen for comparison. Precision and accuracy are commonly used metrics, with precision focusing on positive predictions and accuracy considering both positives and negatives. Recall is useful for minimizing false negatives and identifying all true positives. The study aims to determine which model better predicts match outcomes. The histogram indicates that RF has a higher accuracy value compared to other models, making it more effective in predicting game outcomes. The study advances sports analytics by employing machine learning to predict NBA game outcomes based on player performance and team statistics. It compares various machine learning models, finds Random Forest to be the most effective, and highlights the importance of field goal percentage. However, limitations include the availability and quality of NBA game data, the complexity of the game influenced by multiple factors, and the constraints of machine learning models. Future research could explore different feature engineering techniques, advanced deep learning models like LSTM, and additional factors influencing game outcomes. Embracing sophisticated algorithms and larger datasets could offer deeper insights, making sports analytics an evolving field.
