Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the field of developing machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human cognitive abilities, such as learning, decision making, and problem solving. Essentially, AI aims to replicate human thinking in machines. The rapid advancements in big data, software engineering, and affordable high computing power have made AI a crucial aspect of contemporary research. AI is poised to transform various aspects of our daily lives, with profound impacts across science, engineering, and society. For effective AI implementation, a range of capabilities is essential: natural language processing for communication, knowledge representation for information storage, automated reasoning for answering questions and drawing conclusions, machine learning for pattern recognition and adaptation, and computer vision and robotics for object perception and manipulation. AI systems leverage intelligent algorithms and extensive datasets to learn from patterns and features through iterative processing. While AI and Machine Learning (ML) are often used interchangeably, ML is actually a subset of AI and serves as a method to achieve AI goals. Machine Learning involves extracting valuable insights from data by developing predictive algorithms, which are vital for optimization tasks. The success of these algorithms heavily depends on the quality and quantity of the data used, linking ML closely with statistics and data analysis. Neural Networks, a type of ML algorithm, aim to mimic the human brain's functioning through layers of interconnected nodes that perform nonlinear functions. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), or Deep Learning, involve neural networks with multiple hidden layers. This paper provides an overview of machine learning, emphasizing its application in antenna design. It explores various ML algorithms and their use in antenna design, reviewing the advantages of ML over traditional methods. The findings indicate that machine learning can significantly accelerate the antenna design process, improve accuracy, minimize errors, save time, predict antenna behavior, enhance computational efficiency, and reduce the number of necessary simulations.
