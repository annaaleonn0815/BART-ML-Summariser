In recent years, the IC industry has undergone significant advancements and developments. To evaluate the results of various critical processes such as etch rate, deposition rate, film thickness, chamber matching, chemical mechanical polishing, carrier distribution prediction, and uniformity, the IC sector requires metrology. However, the traditional method of physical measurement is highly demanding in terms of time, equipment, and human resources, making it challenging to implement. Consequently, researchers have focused on developing models to predict these parameters as an alternative to physical measurement. Traditional statistical data-driven methods are significantly influenced by the choice of model, whereas machine learning shows great promise for the prediction of various process parameters in IC manufacturing due to its powerful data processing capabilities and the fact that no exact physical model or prior knowledge are required.",
