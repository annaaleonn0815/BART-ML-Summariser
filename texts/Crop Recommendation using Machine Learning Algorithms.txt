The economies of most countries, particularly in less developed nations, rely significantly on the contribution of agricultural activities. Therefore, high levels of production in the agricultural sector are of paramount importance to the economic well-being of most countries and the welfare of their populations. This holds true for many African countries, including Morocco. The primary challenge for most farmers is deciding what crops to grow. In other words, farmers could be more productive if they knew which types of crops to grow based on their location, its characteristics, and other environmental factors affecting agricultural productivity. Selecting an appropriate crop for a given farm is a complex decision that involves a large number of variables influencing the final yield. This paper explores the application of machine learning (ML) algorithms in developing a crop recommendation system for agriculture. The study focuses on supervised learning techniques, including Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, LightGBM, and Logistic Regression, which analyze large datasets to make predictions or decisions about new data. The proposed crop recommendation system aims to assist farmers in selecting crops suitable for specific soil types and climatic conditions. The use of recommendation systems in agricultural management has recently yielded captivating and promising results, experiencing significant growth due to its benefits in meeting user needs and identifying the most suitable items based on extracted information from data collection. These systems also play a crucial role in decision-making, helping users increase profits or reduce risks. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms in developing a crop recommendation system for agricultural management. By comparing various algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, LightGBM, and Logistic Regression, we found that Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and LightGBM outperform other methods in terms of Accuracy and F1 Score. These algorithms can assist farmers in selecting crops that will yield the best results for specific soil types and climatic conditions, thereby optimizing yields and mitigating risks in agricultural practices. The findings highlight the significant potential of machine learning in revolutionizing crop selection and agricultural decision-making processes.
