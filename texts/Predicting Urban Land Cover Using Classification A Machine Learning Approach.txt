Urban land cover classification plays a crucial role in understanding the advancement of urban environments and their impact on the ecosystem, resource management, and urban planning. Remote sensing data, obtained from satellite or other aerial platforms, provides valuable information about the earth’s surface for detailed analysis, monitoring, and detection. It helps in accurately mapping and monitoring urban land cover. Urban land cover information is a crucial resource for urban management and planning. It can be derived from high-resolution aerial or satellite imagery and has various applications, including mapping green space and impervious surfaces, and updating building footprints. Geographic Information System (GIS) data has been widely used for the analysis of land-based sustainability. However, extracting accurate land cover information from high-resolution data is a complex task. The high degree of spectral variability within land cover classes, caused by factors such as the angle of the sun, gaps in tree canopies, and shadows, can significantly reduce the accuracy of traditional pixel-based image classification methods. This issue is compounded by the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP), which causes a mismatch between pixels and real-world objects of interest. This paper aims to explore the challenges and techniques involved in extracting urban land cover information from high-resolution data while focusing on addressing the MAUP. The paper will also investigate the potential of new techniques such as object-based image analysis (OBIA) and machine learning algorithms in improving the classification accuracy of the model. The extraction of land cover information from remote sensing images can be challenging due to the arbitrary size of pixels, which makes it difficult to correspond them with real-world objects. To tackle this problem, the approach of Geospatial object-based image analysis has been used in several studies. The OBIA approach segments the image into homogeneous regions before classification, and the attributes of these segments are used for classification instead of using the attributes of single pixels. This approach can help reduce within-class spectral variability, incorporate spatial and contextual information, and reduce the sensitivity of classification to the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP). For this research, the aim is to develop a machine learning approach for the prediction of urban land cover using the Urban Land Cover dataset. We will explore various machine learning algorithms used for classification, including Decision Tree classifier, Random Forest classifier, XGBoost classifier, Ridge classifier, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier, to identify the most accurate and efficient method for urban land cover classification. The goal of our research is to develop an accurate land cover classification model that can be deployed in practical applications such as resource management, environmental monitoring, and urban planning. The results of this study will add to the body of knowledge in the field of urban land cover classification using remote sensing and machine learning and may have applications in decision-making, sustainability, and urban management. The study produced observations as referred to in table 1. Table 1 contains the respective accuracy and comprehensive exploration of various classification algorithms, each algorithm bringing distinct attributes to the forefront. A meticulous evaluation of these classifiers was performed across differing feature selections, thereby unveiling unique accuracy scores associated with each of them. Ultimately, the study concludes that the Random Forest classification algorithm emerges as the most effective choice for the model. Characterized by its ensemble learning technique and amalgamation of multiple decision trees, Random Forest leverages the majority vote of these trees for accurate class prediction. To optimize its performance, the study employs Grid Search CV. Grid Search CV, which stands for Grid Search Cross-Validation, is a crucial technique in machine learning for systematically fine-tuning hyper-parameters of a model to achieve optimal performance. It helps in finding the best hyperparameters for the machine learning model and facilitates the enhancement of the model’s fit to the dataset. The paper provides an overview of using Grid Search CV for tuning the hyperparameters of the Random Forest classifier on Sentinel-2 data, which plays a pivotal role in attaining heightened accuracy in this research. Different machine learning algorithms have been used for urban land cover classification, and it is found that Random Forest has achieved the best performance. The use of different feature selection methods has also been explored, and it was found that the best results are obtained by using all the features and not dropping any, as every feature in the dataset provides important insights into the spectral, textural, size, and shape of the land cover. The results clearly suggest that machine learning is a promising approach for urban land cover classification. Random Forests are able to achieve high accuracy and are relatively insensitive to noise. The use of spectral and spatial features can further improve the accuracy of classification.
