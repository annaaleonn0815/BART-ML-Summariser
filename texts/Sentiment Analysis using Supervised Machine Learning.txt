Human beings are very subjective in nature and they do make judgments based on their satisfaction with a service or product. Information systems gain many advantages if they can interact with people at this level, such as improving product quality, adjusting business strategies and marketing, enhancing customer service, managing crises, and monitoring performance. Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is implemented using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It is used to extract the emotions hidden behind text reviews or comments. These reviews or comments often act as metrics in business, providing information about the service or product and reflecting customer satisfaction. This approach utilizes NLP techniques to recognize the emotions in any text body. Organizations can categorize opinions about a product, service, or idea using this popular method. With the help of Machine Learning (ML), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Data Analysis, NLP works to find text sentiment. Organizations implement NLP with ML and AI to analyze various forms of text data gathered from different sources, whether organized or unstructured. Manual data processing is replaced by algorithms that use new techniques or hybrid methods. Hybrid sentiment analysis consolidates two methodologies. Feelings are significant not only in personal life but also in business. Understanding how your audience feels about your products or brand provides context to assess your marketing and communication strategy. Sentiment analysis helps you understand the insights your clients leave online, revealing what they want from your product, what features they miss, and what they like or dislike. This helps in pinpointing numerous comments, reaching inferences, and adjusting your marketing strategy and product accordingly. Examining marketing metrics individually is not the best way to gauge marketing performance. The final model in the study is a fully tuned model capable of analyzing the sentiment of movie reviews, whether they are in the dataset or not. During the data preprocessing phase, only a portion of the dataset is exposed to the model to achieve better results under general conditions and to obtain unbiased optimized results for both dataset reviews and reviews outside the dataset. The study results show that the Support Vector Machine (SVM) has outperformed both other algorithms used in the project. The accuracy score of the SVM is 0.84, which is significantly better than the Decision Tree algorithm, which has an accuracy score of 0.64. The Logistic Regression algorithm has an accuracy score of 0.83, better than the Decision Tree but still underperforming compared to SVM. Thus, SVM has the best accuracy among all the algorithms implemented in the project, providing a clear advantage in terms of accuracy. The model was further tuned with GridsearchCV to optimize performance. Support Vector Machine: 0.84, Logistic Regression: 0.83, Decision Tree: 0.64
