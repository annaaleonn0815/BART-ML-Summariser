This study explores the application of machine learning and computer vision in a variety of industries, including production lines, healthcare, education, transportation, and food. Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that trains computers to think like humans by learning from and expanding upon previous experiences. Computer vision and machine learning techniques are used to identify and track complex human actions in multimedia streams. The study highlights the importance of image segmentation, localization, classification, and object detection in each application area. It also discusses which Python libraries have been used in each field, including support vector machines, neural networks, KNN and probabilistic graphical models.
