This study explores the growing importance of Machine Learning (ML) in the field of computer networking. The study argues that traditional algorithmic and heuristic approaches for network management are falling behind the expected levels of performance due to the growing complexity of network architectures. It argues that ML has shown remarkable results in various problem domains such as discovering new antibiotic drugs, generating high-fidelity images from arbitrary text prompts, and even finding new mathematical conjectures. The research highlights the challenges and opportunities of ML in improving network performance, highlighting the need for better data collection, training, and data collection practices.
