This study addresses the challenges of improving balance in people with balance impairments. Balance impairments can lead to loss of mobility, anxiety, and reduced quality of life. In clinics, PTs select and customize balance exercises for each individual, but in home rehabilitation, individuals often refer to instructions previously provided by PTs in the clinic or paper-based instructions when performing exercises at home. To improve the effectiveness of in-home balance training, researchers have introduced remote supervision (e.g., telerehabilitation), sensory augmentation, and video game-based balance training. This study introduces an IMU-based approach to automatically assess balance performance based on trunk sway from sensor data.
