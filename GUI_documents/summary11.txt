This study focuses on the application of electroencephalography (EEG), a method of measuring electrical signals in the brain that is used to diagnose and treat various brain disorders such as epilepsy, tremor, concussions, strokes, and sleep disorders. There is a growing interest in studying EEG signals for gaming to control and manipulate objects using brainwaves due to EEG monitoring for brain activity during tasks. The study focuses primarily on conventional scalp EEG signals, but there also exists iEEG signals, which are taken inside the brain. The research highlights the growing importance of using machine learning to improve the accuracy and accuracy of EEG analysis, particularly for epileptic seizure detection and sleep disorder research.
