Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that trains computers to think like humans by learning from and expanding upon previous experiences. It employs minimal human intervention to analyze data and spot trends. Machine learning has a wide range of effects on society, including production lines, healthcare, education, transportation, and food. Machine learning is transforming our lives and industries in housing and apps, cars, retail, the food industry, etc. The goal of machine learning and computer vision is to impart to computers the ability to gather data, understand it, and make decisions based on previous and present results. Computer vision is important for the Internet of Things, Industrial Internet of Things, and human cognitive interfaces. Computer vision and machine learning techniques are used to identify and track complex human actions in multimedia streams. For the prediction and analysis task of data, there are three types of learning: supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised. The ability of computers to gather data, interpret it and make decisions based on past and present results is the aim of machine learning and computer vision. Computer vision is essential for the Internet of Things, Industrial Internet of Things, and human cognitive interfaces. Computer vision and machine learning techniques are used to identify and track complex human actions in multimedia streams. The image segmentation, localization & classification, and object detection are shown in figure 1. The authors have outlined the application areas of computer vision in figure 4. They have listed which machine learning techniques and Python Libraries have been employed in each field. An essential method of image processing that examines the contents of the image is segmentation. Image segmentation can be used for pattern recognition, feature extraction, content-based image retrieval, etc. Image segmentation is an important process in most medical image analysis. K-means is a widely used clustering algorithm to partition data into k clusters. The K-means and fuzzy K-means clustering algorithms can be used to identify tumor cells in MR images that may show the characteristics of the tumor's severity, facilitating the necessary diagnosis and therapy. There are numbers of well-established algorithms for prediction and analysis such as supervised learning, un-supervised learning, and semi-supervised learning. These methods use the machine learning algorithms such as support vector machine, KNN etc. Scipy, Scikit, OpenCV, Matplotlib and Keras are the popular are libraries used for image segmentation. For object detection previously sliding window, selective search and Kadane's algorithms were used but now most of the application areas uses deep learning algorithms like RCNN, YOLO, SSD for object detection in CV. The software libraries utilized in object detection for computer vision are Tensor Flow, ImageAI, GluonCV and YOLOv7. Convolution neural networks, recurrent neural networks, long short-term memories, gated recurrent units, and Bayesian networks are all used in traffic detection models. Sensors in intelligent settings collect data that is later analyzed and forecasted. One of the tasks the convolution neural network (CNN) successfully completes for successful object detection is feature extraction. With a big collection of face photos, a deep convolution neural network can recognize faces through supervised learning. Data annotation and labeling is the only problem in computer vision and machine learning applications. The support vector machines, neural networks, KNN and probabilistic graphical models machine learning paradigms for computer vision. A common classification technique is support vector machines (SVMs), a subfield of supervised machine learning techniques. With a maximum margin separating two significant classified classes, SVMs seek to locate a hyperplane. Layered networks of connected processing nodes make up a neural network. A class of neural networks called convolution neural networks (CNNs) is utilized for image recognition and categorization. It has neurons that are wide, large, and deep. Due to widely available datasets, GPUs, and regularization approaches, CNN has become more and more popular in recent years. The paper looks at a variety of machine learning applications in computer vision. For instance, biological sciences include segmentation, feature extraction, pattern matching, visual model optimization, form representation, surface reconstruction, and modeling. Computer vision uses machine learning to evaluate data from images that detect cars and pedestrians, using images to analyze remote sensing data for geographic information systems, diagnose faults in railroad ties automatically, identify different varieties of mango fruit based on size attributes, and extract graphical and textual information from document images. Detecting curb ramps in Google Street View, automatically detecting and identifying faces, machine vision, handwriting recognition, enhanced driving assistance systems, and behavioral measures are some of the other techniques. Computer vision and machine learning are also used in the medical field, especially in nuclear medicine, endoscopy, angiography, magnetic resonance, ultrasound, and microscopy, according to studies in this field. Engineering, health, agriculture, astronomy, sports, cyber security, and education are among the many fields where machine learning and computer vision are used. Machine learning and deep learning popularity have grown recently across several industries. The combination of machine learning and artificial intelligence methods has been used in many applications to carry out various computer vision tasks.
